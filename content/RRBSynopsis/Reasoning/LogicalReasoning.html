			<p>
			It refers the information which is implied or inferred from a statement, that means the information is never clearly stated. <br />
			Inference means a fact that can truly be inferred from the contents of a given statement. Here, candidates are required to approach the questions from a logical angle. In this section of logical reasoning, the question consists one or two statements followed by certain inferences based on it.</p>
			<h3 class="skill-heading" id="01"> Types of Questions </h3>
			<p>Logical reasoning may be categorised in two types.</p>
			<h4 class="skill-subheading">Type 1 </h4>
			<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Statement and Conclusion</h5>
			<p>A conclusion means a fact that can be truly inferred from the context of a given statement or the passage. Hence, a conclusion is the brief or point of view that is supported or defended with the premises.<br />
			In these types of questions, a statement or a set of statements followed by some inferences is given. Candidates are required to analyse the given statement and understand their indirect implications and decide which of the given conclusions logically follows from the given statements.</p>
			<h4 class="skill-subheading">Type 2 </h4>
			<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Statement and Assumption </h5>
			<p>An assumption is the hidden part of an argument and something supposed or taken for grant.<br />
			In these types of questions, a statement is followed by two or more assumptions. Candidates are required to access the given statement and decide which of the given assumption implicit directly in the statement. </p>

			<h4 class="skill-subheading">Statement and Conclusion</h4>
			 <p>While solving the question asked from this chapter, we should keep these important points in our mind. </p>
			 <ul>
			 <li>The presence of words like although, inspite of, because of and despite of favours a valid conclusion.</li>
			 <li>A conclusion can be valid which is directly related with context to the given statement.</li>
			 <li>A conclusion can be valid if seems with positive action context to the given statement.</li>
			 <li> A conclusion can be valid if seems easy to derived from the given statement.</li>
			 <li>A conclusion cannot be valid which consists any of hard condition, such as Only, Best, Definitely, Certainly, Strongest and All.</li>
			 <li> The relation between statement and conclusion, as directly related conclusion can easily be derived from the statement.</li>
			 <li>A conclusion with positive action is always valid.</li>
			 <li>A conclusion with negative action is never valid.</li>
			 <li>The hard condition all the time.</li>
			 </ul>
			 <h4 class="skill-subheading">Statement and Assumption</h4>
			 <ul>
			 <li>Sometimes assumptions are contrary to their statement or not connected with the statement and can easily be rejected.</li>
			 <li>An assumption is invalid if it is a mere restatement putting it it different words of given statement.</li>
			 <li>The given assumption is invalid if it is an inferrence derivable from given statement.</li>
			 <li>An assumption is invalid if it uses farfetched reasoning.</li>
			 <li>Statement is a part of our speech of which most of the ideas rema unexpressed.</li>
			 <li>Assumption is something in which the readers assume on the basis of the given statement.</li>
			 <li>If statement and assumption are not co-related then it is not implicit validity.</li>
			 <li>Assumption is always positive regarding the complition of the work favouring the executor.</li>
			 <li>Request/Order/Advise is considered valid in the case of assumption.</li>

			 <h4 class="solved-examples-question"> Example 1: </h4>
            <p>In the given question, a statement is given followed by two conclusions I and II. You have to consider the statement to be true even if they seem to be at variance from commonly known facts. You have to decide which of the given conclusions, if any follow from the given statement. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Statement:</span> <br />
			Uneducated people are exploited by others in the society. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Conclusion:</span> </p>
			<ol class="ordered-list-upper-roman">
			<li>People take advantage of uneducated people only.</li>
			<li>Educated people exploit uneducated persons in society.</li>

            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:(d)</span>
             The word 'only' in conclusion I unfavours the condition while in conclusion II, educated people exploit uneducated persons is not mentioned in the given statement.<br />
			 <span class="highlight01"> Directions: </span> <br />
			One statement is given followed by two conclusions I and II. You have to consider the statements to be true even if they seem to be at variance from commonly known facts. You have to decide which of the given conclusions, if any follow from the given statements.</p>

			<h4 class="solved-examples-question"> Example 4: </h4>
			<p>In the given question, a statement is followed by two assumption numbered I and II. An assumption is something supposed or taken for granted. You have to decide which of the following assumption is implict in the statement.<br />
            <span class="highlight01">Statement:</span> <br />
			Statement In city 'Z' people prefer to buy car 'X' instead of car 'Y' as car 'X' has German Technology which is very advanced.<br />
			 <span class="highlight01">Conclusion:</span>  </p>
			 <ol class="ordered-list-upper-roman">
			 <li> Cars with German Technology are perceived to be better than other cars in city Z.</li>

                </ol>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:(a)</span> It seems that German Technology is better than other technology, so it would increase the sale of car 'X'.. So assumption I is implicit while assumption II indicates the possible result of the sale which cannot be assumed.</p>
			<h4 class="solved-examples-question"> Example 5: </h4>
			<p>One statement is given followed by two assumptions I and II. You have to consider the statements to be true even if it seems to be at variance from commonly known facts. You have to decide which of the given assumptions, if any, follow from the given statements.<br />
            <span class="highlight01">Statement:</span> <br />
			Politicians become rich by the votes of the people.<br />
			 <span class="highlight01">Assumption:</span>  </p>

            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:(a)</span> In statement, it is strictly said that politicians become rich due to votes of the people which is fully implemented in the assumption I. Assumption II is not directly related to statement. So. only assumption I is implicit.</p>
