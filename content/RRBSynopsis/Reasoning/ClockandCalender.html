			This chapter is designed to test a candidate's ability in understanding time reasoning problem. This chapter is divided in two forms i.e., clock and calendar.
			</p>
			<h3 class="skill-heading" id="01"> Clock </h3>
			<p>
			Measurement of time is an important aspect of our daily life. It helps us to prepare our schedule and work in an orderly manner. There are mainly, four important parts of a clock-Dial, Hour hand, Minute hand and Second hand.</p>
			<div class="synopsis-image"> <img src="114104019_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"> </div>
			<h4 class="skill-subheading">The Dial </h4>
			<p>
			The dial of a clock is circular one, whose circumference is divided into 12 parts (12 equal big divisions) labelled as 1, 2, 3, 4, ... and 12. The space between every pair of two numbers is divided in 5 equal small divisions. Thus, the dial is divided into 60 small divisions. <br />
			The clock has three hands. One is longer (second hand), middle (minute hand) and another is shorter (hour hand).</p>
			<h4 class="skill-subheading">Minute Hand </h4>
			<p>
			The longer hand of the clock is known as minute hand. The minute hand moves from one small division to the next small division in 1 min. <br />
			The minute hand goes once round the dial in 1 h. Thus, the minute hand covers 60 small divisions in 1 h. <br />
			60 min = An hour <br />
			30 min = Half an hour <br />
			15 min = Quarter of an hour </p>
			<h4 class="skill-subheading">Hour Hand </h4>
			<p>
			The shorter hand of the clock is known as hour hand. The hour hand moves from one number to the next number in 1 h. The hour hand takes 12 h to complete one round. Also, it takes 2 full rounds of the clock in a day. Its movement is also in a clockwise direction. <br />
			l day = 24 h </p>
			<h4 class="skill-subheading">Second Hand </h4>
			<p>
			We may come across some clocks or watches which have three hands. The third hand which is very thin is called the second hand. <br />
			The second's hand makes full round in 1 min and the time in which it moves between two successive small divisions is called 1. <br />Thus.	60 s = 1 min </p>
			<h3 class="skill-heading" id="02"> Types of Clock </h3>
			<p>
			We generally use 12 h clocks. The face of these clocks is marked with numbers from 1 to 12 and the hour hand of the clock goes round the dial (face) twice a day (in 24 h).<br />
			But Railways, Air lines time tables, Shipping lines, Defence forces and Television networks etc. do not use 12 h clock time. Instead, they use 24 h clock time. Digital watches also show 24 h clock time. A 24 h clock dial may be visualized as the one given below. </p>
			<div class="synopsis-image"> <img src="114104019_image-2.png" alt="image2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"> </div>
			<p>
			The use of 24 h clock time is very useful. The time is expressed by four digits. The first two digits on the left denote hours while the right two digits denote minutes. The day starts at 12 midnight and is written as 0000 h. Hence, the time in this clock type of is expressed as 12 o'clock midnight is written as 2400 h or 0000 h. <br />
			3 : 00 am is written as 0300 h. <br />
			11 : 00 am is written as 1100 h.<br />
			2 : 00 pm is written as 1400 h. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Fast and Slow </span><br />
			If a watch or a clock indicates 6:15, when the correct time is 6, it is said to be 15 min fast. On the other hand, if it indicates 5:45, when the correct time is 6, it is said to be 15 min slow. </p>
			<h4 class="skill-subheading">points to Remember </h4>
			<ul>
			<li>In 60 min, the minute hand gains 55 min on the hour hand. </li>
			<li>In every hour, both the hands coincide once.</li>
			<li>The hands are in the same straight line when they are coincident or opposite to each other. When the two hands are at right angles <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (90^{\circ})  \) </span>they are 15 min space apart.</li>
			<li> When the hands are in opposite directions, they are 30 min space apart.</li>
			<li>Angle traced by hour hand in 12 h = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  360^{\circ}  \) </span></li>
			<li>Angle traced by minute hand in 60 min =<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  360^{\circ}  \) </span></li>
			<li>Both hands of a clock occurs right angle twice in one hour, 22 times in 12 h and 44 times in 24 h.</li>
			<li>Both hands of a clock occurs straight or opposite once in one hour, 11 times in 12 h and 22 times in 24 h.</li>
			<li> When minute hand covers distance of 1 min, in this time, hour hand covers distance of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   {\frac{1}{2}}^{\circ}  \) </span>.</li></ul>
			<h3 class="skill-heading" id="03"> Calendar </h3>
			<p>
			The record of all the days of the year is given in the calendar. It shows the months, weeks and days in the year.</p>
			<div class="synopsis-image"> <img src="114104019_image-3.png" alt="image3" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"> </div>
			<h4 class="skill-subheading">Week Days</h4>
			<p>
			There are seven days in a week. A week starts with Monday and ends at Sunday. After which again comes Monday. The same cycle goes on and on.</p>
			<h4 class="skill-subheading">Months of the Year</h4>
			<p>
			We know that, there are 12 months in a year. The months of the year with the number of days in that month are given below.</p>

		 February of an ordinary year has 28 days. There are 365 days in an ordinary year. Thus, 1 ordinary year = 365 days = 52 weeks and 1 day. February of a leap year has 29 days, so, there are 366 days in a leap year. Thus, 1 leap year = 366 days = 52 weeks and 2 days. A leap year comes after every 4 yr.
		 </p>
		 <h4 class="skill-subheading">Century</h4>
		 <p>
		 A block of 100 yr is called a century. A century has, thus a total of 100 yr. Thus, each one of the years 1100, 1800, 2000, 2100 is a century.
		 </p>
		 <h4 class="skill-subheading">Leap Year</h4>
		 <p>
		 The year other than a century divisible by 4 as well as by 400 is called a leap year. Thus, each one of the years 1600, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 is a leap year and none of the years 1867, 1993, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2007 is a leap year. </p>
		 <h4 class="skill-subheading">Ordinary Year</h4>
		 <p>
		 The year which is not a leap year is called an ordinary year. Thus, each one of the years 1781, 1891, 1995, 1999, 2013 is an ordinary year.</p>
		 <h4 class="skill-subheading">Points to Remember</h4>
		 <ul>
		 <li>A leap year has 52 weeks and 2 days.</li>
		 <li>An ordinary year has 52 weeks and 1 day.</li>
		 <li>A year has 52 full weeks.</li>
		 <li><span class="highlight01"> Odd Days: </span>  <br />
		 In a given period, the number of days more than the complete weeks are called odd days. Also, when total number of days divided by 7 remainder called odd days.<br />
		 1 ordinary year = 365 days = (52 weeks + 1 day)</li>
		 <li>1 leap year = 366 days = (52 weeks + 2 days) 100 yr = 76 ordinary years + 24 leap years = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (76 \times 1 + 24 \times 2)  \) </span> odd days = 124 odd days = (17 weeks + 5 days) = 5 odd days <br />

             The year 2012 is a leap year It has 2 odd days. The day on 8th February, 2012 is 2 days before the day on 8th February, 2013. <br />

             2nd July, 1984 means (1983 yr 6 months and 2 days) 1900 years have 1 odd day 83 yr have 20 leap years and 63 ordinary years.<br />

			 6 months and 2 days <br />
			 Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May June July <br />
			 31	  29	31	30	 31	 30	  2 <br />
