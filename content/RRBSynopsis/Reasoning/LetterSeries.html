            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="01">Introduction</h3>
            <p> In this chapter, a series of single pairs or groups of letters or combinations of letters are given. Each pair or single element is called the term. The terms of the series form a certain pattern as regards the position of the letters in the English alphabets. You are required to identify this pattern and find the missing or wrong term in the given series which satisfies the pattern.
           </p>
           <h3 class="skill-heading" id="02">Types Of Questions</h3>
           <p> There are mainly three types of questions asked from letter series in various competitive exams. They are as follows. </p>
           <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 1 </h4>
		   <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Alphabet Series </h5>
                   <p>In this type, the terms of the series form a particular pattern as regards the position of the letters in the English alphabets. </p>
               <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 2 </h4>
			   <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Continuous Pattern Series </h5>
                   <p>In this type, a series of small/capital letters are given which follow a particular pattern. However, some letters are missing from the series. In some of the questions involving alphabetical series, a set of letters is given four or five times with blank spaces or question mark in between. The series follows a specific pattern and you are required to find the letter which should come in place of the blank space or question mark. </p>
               <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 3 </h4>
			   <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Conditional Letter Series </h5>
                   <p>In this type, a series of letters are given and candidate is asked to trace out the particular letter. </p>
           <h3 class="skill-heading" id="03">Expert Insight</h3>
           <ul>
               <li> In continuous pattern series, sometimes it happens that increasing order letter in every next block e.g., <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a \underline{b} / a \underline{b} \underline{b} / a \underline{bb} b / abbb \underline{b}  \) </span> <br />                    In this series 'b' is increasing in every block. </li>
               <li> In continuous pattern series, firstly, count the total given letters and blanks and secondly, find out the how many multiple of numbers are exist in the series like as an above example, there are 12 places which having letters and blanks so 12 could be the multiple of <br />
                   <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = 3 \times 4 = 4 \times 3 = 6 \times 2  \) </span> <br />
                   Here, we prefer 12 as 4 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> 3 because series are divide in 3 part and bccb is carting on. <br />
                   <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  bc \underline{c} b / \underline{b} c \underline{c} b / \underline{b} ccb  \) </span> </li>
               </ol>
