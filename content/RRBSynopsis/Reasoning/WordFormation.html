            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="01">Introduction</h3>
            <p> Word formation is advanced level alphabet test. This test is meant to test the ability of the candidate in word building process. In word formation, a main word is given and we have to choose that word, which can or cannot be formed from the main word. Sometime, a set of English letters are given in a jumbled order and the candidates are asked to arrange them in a meaningful order. In some situations we are asked to choose particular letters from a word and arrange them to form a meaningful word.
            </p>
           <h3 class="skill-heading" id="02"> Types of Questions </h3>
           <p> In this chapter, we will deal with two types of questions
            <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 1 </h4>
			<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Word Formation Using Letters from a Given Word </h5>
                   <p>In this type, two subtypes of questions are asked generally. </p>
                   <ul>
                   <li> <span class="highlight01"> First </span> A word has been given, followed by four other words, one of which can or cannot be formed by using the main word. </li>
                   <li> <span class="highlight01"> Second </span> A word has been given and candidates are asked to form as many meaningful English words as possible from the given word, using each letter only once in each word. </li>
                   </ul>
               <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 2 </h4>
			   <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Word Formation by Unscrambling Letters </h5>
                   <p>In this type of questions, a set of English letters is given in a jumbled order. The candidate is required to arrange these letters to form a meaningful word. <br />
                   Always try to place the letter according to the numbers provided in option that will provide you correct answer rather than doing it on the basis of your vocabulary knowledge.</p>
            <h3 class="Solved Examples"> Solved Examples </h3>
            <p> <span class="highlight01"> Directions </span> (Q. Nos. 1 and 2) In each of the following questions, a word has been given, followed by four other words, one of which cannot be formed by using the letters of the given word. Find out that word.
               <h4 class="solved-examples-question"> Example 1: </h4>
               <p> CONSTRUCTION </p>
               <ol class="ordered-list-lower-case">

               <p>  CAUTION - All the letters except A are present in the main word. <br />
               Hence, CAUTION cannot be formed from the letters of the given word CONSTRUCTION.
