			<p>In this chapter, we deal with the questions based on sitting arrangement. We are given few objects and then we are to arrange them based on according to the information provided. Objects are arranged either in row or in a circle on basis of such conditions provided. In other questions, we will also deal with arrangements square/pentagon/hexagon/octagon. </p>
			<h3 class="skill-heading" id="01">Types of Questions</h3>
			<p>
			There are two types of questions which are generally asked in various competitive exams.
			</p>
			<h4 class="skill-subheading">Type 1</h4>
			<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Arrangement Around a Circle/Square </h5>
			<p>
			In such questions, we are given some clues regarding the arrangement. We have to apply these clues on a circle and using these informations, we have to find the solutions to questions associated with them. We also deal with square and rectangle arrangement in this section.
			</p>
			<h4 class="skill-subheading">Type 2 </h4>
			<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Arrangement in a Line </h5>
			<p>
			Sometime, we deal with questions, where arrangement is required to be done in a line.<br />
			Before solving this type of questions, it is necessary to know the following fact. <br />
			When A, B, C, D facing at South direction and P, Q, R, S facing at North direction in a line, then positions at their right and left will be </p>
