            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="01">Introduction</h3>
            <p> In this chapter, we deal with the questions which are based on directions and displacements. Direction is a measurement of position of one thing with respect to another thing and displacement is the measurement of distance between the starting and the final point. <br />
            A successive follow-up of directions is formulated and the candidate is required to ascertain the final direction or the distance between two points. This test is designed to judge the candidate's ability to trace and follow the logical path correctly and sense the direction correctly.
           </p>
           <h3 class="skill-heading" id="02">Main Directions</h3>
           <p> There are four main directions, viz. East, West, North and South. Sun rises in the East. Just opposite of East is West and South is in the opposite to North. </p>
            <div class="synopsis-image"> <img src="114104013_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"> </div>
            <p> Abbreviations for these directions are E (East), W (West), N (North) and S (South). </p>
            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="03">Cardinal Directions</h3>
            <p> A direction between two main directions is called cardinal direction. Clearly, there are four cardinal directions. <br />
            They are N-E (North-East), N-W (North-West), SE (South-East) and S-W (South-West). Students are advised to use of diagram as given in question for the purpose of sensing directions. </p>

            <p> Angle formed between two main directions is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  90^{\circ}  \) </span> and angle formed between a cardinal direction and main direction is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  45^{\circ}  \) </span>. </p>

            <li>	Right turn = Clockwise turn </li>
            <li>	Left turn = Anti-clockwise turn </li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="04">Shortest Distance</h3>
            <p> For finding shortest distance, it is necessary to know Pythagoras theorem. <br />
            AB = Perpendicular, <br />
            BC = Base, AC = Hypotenuse <br />
            AC = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2}  \) </span> </p>

            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="05">Types Of Questions</h3>
           <p> There are three types of questions are generally asked in various competitive examination. </p>
           <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 1 </h4>
		   <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Based on Final Direction </h5>
                   <p>In this type of questions, we have to ascertain the final direction with respect to starting point or the directional relations between two points/persons/things used in questions. </p>
               <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 2 </h4>
			   <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Based on Displacement </h5>
                   <p>In this type of questions, we deal with final distance between starting and fmal point or distance between two points/ persons/things. </p>
               <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 3 </h4>
			   <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Based on Direction and Displacement </h5>
                  <p>In this type of questions, we deal with the final distance and direction between starting and final point of any person/object or thing. </p>

             <p> Shyam goes to 5 km in the North from his school. Now, turning to the left, he goes to 10 km and again turn to left and goes to 5 km. How far he is from his school and in which direction? </p>
            <ol class="ordered-list-lower-case">

           <p> Let point A is the starting point i.e., school of Shyam. <br />
           Point D is the ending point. <br />
           From figure, <br />
           AB = CD = 5 km <br />
           and	AD = BC = 10 km <br />
           So, Shyam is 10 km far away from his school and in west direction from school.
