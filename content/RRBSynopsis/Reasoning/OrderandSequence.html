            <p> The process of determining the position or place of a person or a thing on the basis of comparison or relative position of other person or a thing is called order and sequence. In order and sequence test, relative position or rank of different groups of persons or objects are given. Students are required to establish the rank or position of other individual in the same group with respect to one another. <br />
            It is the process of determining the order/position through the set of information containing certain conditions. Candidates are required to arrange the objects with the prescribed order. Information given in the question is presented in distorted form to create confusion and to test candidate's ability to analyse the relationship between the given information step by step in order to answer the question correctly.
           </p>
            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="02">Types Of Questions</h3>
           <p> As per its characterstics order and sequence can be classified in two types. </p>
           <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 1 </h4>
		   <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Comparision based Sequence </h5>
                   <p>It is the process of arranging the objects according to comperative qualities that they have. Here objects are arranged as per their heights, marks, earnings, size, weights etc. </p>
               <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 2 </h4>
			   <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Position based Sequence </h5>
                   <p>It is the process of arranging the objects according to their positions. In such questions position of a person or an object is mentioned with respected to another. Candidates are required to arrange the given set of information with the related positions. </p>

           <ul>
               <li> In a row/class, if a person rank is given from two sides, then we find total number of persons in that row/class by below method. Total number of persons in a row/class = (Rank of that person from upper/left end) + (Rank of that person from lower/right end) - 1 (L + R - 1), (U + B - 1) </li>
               <li> In a row/class, if total number of persons is given and also a particular person lower/right end rank is given, then we find that particular person rank from the upper/left end by below method. </li>
               <li> Rank of that particular person from upper/left end = (Total number of persons in row/class) - (That particular person rank from lower/right end) + 1 (T - One side value + 1) </li>
               <li> In a row/class, if total number of persons are given and also a particular person upper/left end rank is given, then we find that particular person rank from the lower/right end by below method. </li>
               <li> Rank of that particular person from lower/right end = (Total number of persons in row/class) - (That particular person rank from upper/left) + 1 (T - One side value + 1) <br />
