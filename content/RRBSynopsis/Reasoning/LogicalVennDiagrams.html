			In this chapter, we deal with questions which aim at analysing a candidate's ability to relate a certain given group of items and illustrate it diagrammatically. Figures representing groups of items in the form of enclosed regions are called venn diagrams named after the British logician John venn. To represent these diagrams, we use different geometrical figures like circles, triangles, squares and rectangles etc. </p>
			<h3 class="skill-heading" id="01"> Types of Questions </h3>
			<p>In this chapter. we will deal with basically three entities. There are following five types of questions which are generally asked in various competitions. </p>
			<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 1 </h4>
			<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Universal Affirmative </h5>
			<p>When one group of items is completely included in the second group of items and the second, again completely belongs to the third group is called Universal Affirmative, the venn diagram would be as follows. <br />
			e.g., Polygon, Rectangle, Square. </p>
			<div class="synopsis-image"> <img src="114104018_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"> </div>
			<p>
			 All Squares are Rectangles and all Rectangles are Polygons. Hence, this case comes under Universal Affirmative.</p>
			 <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 2 </h4>
			 <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Universal Negative </h5>
			  <p>If the items evidently belong to three different groups, i.e., they are not correlated with each other in any way, called Universal Negative.<br />
			  e.g., Intelligence, Anxiety, Strength  </p>
			  <div class="synopsis-image"> <img src="114104018_image-2.png" alt="image2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"> </div>
			  <p>
			  Anxiety, Intelligence and Strength are entirely different from each other. </p>
			  <h4 class="skill-subheading">Type 3 </h4>
			  <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Particular Affirmative or Negative </h5>
			  <p>In this type, two entities are correlated and statements arise like some - first entity belongs to second entity. <br />
			  e.g., Teachers, Authors, Men </p>
			  <div class="synopsis-image"> <img src="114104018_image-3.png" alt="image3" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"> </div>
			  <p>
			  Here, some Teachers may be Authors and some Teachers may be Men. Also, some Authors may be Men. So, the given items are partly related to each other. </p>
			  <h4 class="skill-subheading">Type 4 </h4>
			  <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Miscellaneous </h5>
			  <p>In this type, we deal with the questions which belong to atleast two types as discussed earlier. Different types of cases that can be studied under this type are as follows. <br />
			  <span class="highlight01">Case I</span> <br />
			  If two separate groups of items are completely unrelated to each other, but they are all completely included in the third group, then the relationships can be diagrammatically shown as. <br />
			  e.g., Vehicle, Car, Bus. </p>
			  <div class="synopsis-image"> <img src="114104018_image-4.png" alt="image4" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"> </div>
			  <p>
			  Bus and Car are entirely different. But both are Vehicles.<br />
			  <span class="highlight01">Case II</span> <br />
			  When two groups of items have some common relationship and both of them are completely included in the third group, the relationships are shown by two smaller intersecting circles in a third large circle. <br />
			  e.g., Animal, Dog, Pet.</p>
			   <div class="synopsis-image"> <img src="114104018_image-5.png" alt="image5" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"> </div>
			   <p>Some Dogs are Pets and some Pets are Dogs but all Dogs and Pets are Animals.<br />
			   <span class="highlight01">Case III</span> <br />
			   If one group of items is partly included in the second group of items and the third group is completely unrelated to these two groups, their relationship is diagrammatically shown as. <br />
			   e.g.. Wire, Copper, Paper</p>
			   <div class="synopsis-image"> <img src="114104018_image-6.png" alt="image6" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"> </div>
			   <p> Some Wires are made of Copper but Paper is entirely different.<br />
			   <span class="highlight01">Case IV</span> <br />
			   If one item belongs to the class of second and the third item is partly related to these two, they are represented as shown.<br />
			   e.g., Females, Mothers, Doctors </p>
			   <div class="synopsis-image"> <img src="114104018_image-7.png" alt="image7" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"> </div>
			   <p>All Mothers are Females but some Females and some Mothers can be Doctors. So, the circles representing Doctors would intersect both of the two concentric circles.</p>
			   <h4 class="skill-subheading">Type 5 </h4>
			   <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Geometrical Figures Venn Diagrams</h5>
			   <p>In this type, we formed the venn diagrams by using different geometrical figures. Till now, we have used only circles to represent different relationship. Here, we will use different geometrical figures to show different relationship. e.g.,<br />

			   (Q.Nos. 1 and 2)Study the figure given below carefully and answer the questions that follow.</p>
			   <div class="synopsis-image"> <img src="114104018_image-8.png" alt="image8" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"> </div>
			   <p><span class="highlight01">example 1</span> <br />
             Which part shows Literate Males, who are Doctors? <br/>
			 <span class="highlight01">Sol:</span> <br />
			  To depict the required part the figure should show all three diagrams, i.e., E. E belongs to all Males. Doctor and Literate. <br />
			  <span class="highlight01">example 2</span><br />
			  Which part shows Males, who are neither Doctor nor Literate? <br />
			  <span class="highlight01">Sol:</span> <br />
			  To depict the required part, the figure should show only Males, i.e., C. C belongs to only Males.
