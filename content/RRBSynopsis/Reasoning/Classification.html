            <p> Classification means 'to assort the items' from a given group on the basis of a certain common quality they possess and then spot the stranger or 'odd one out'. These questions are based on words, letters and numerals. In these types of problems, we consider the defining quality of particular things. In these questions, four or five elements or parts are given, out of which one does not belong to the group. You are required to find the 'odd one'.
            </p>
            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="02">Types Of Questions </h3>
            <p> There are three types of questions based on classification which we shall consider here. </p>
            <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 1 </h4>
			<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Choosing the Odd Word </h5>
                    <p>In this type of problems, some words are given which belong to real world. They have some common features except the odd one. You are required to find the 'odd one out'. </p>
                <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 2 </h4>
				<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Choosing the Odd Letter Group </h5>
                    <p>In this type of problems, some groups of letters are given. One out of them is different and this is to be chosen by the candidate as the answer. </p>
                <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type 3 </h4>
				<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Choosing the Odd Number/Pair of Numbers </h5>
                    <p>In this type of questions, certain numbers/pair of numbers are given, out of which except one, all have some common characteristics and hence are alike. The 'different one' is to be chosen as the answer. </p>
            <h3 class="Solved Examples"> Solved Examples </h3>
            <p> <span class="highlight01"> Directions </span> (Q.Nos. 1 and 2) In each of the following questions, four words have been given out of which three are alike in some manner while the one of them is different. Choose the odd one.
