			This chapter tests the ability to solve basic mathematical problems encountered in everyday life. It is a method in which logical thinking is embedded. <br />
			A problem describes the essentials of some situation assumed to be familiar to the candidate and candidate must know the theme of problem which refers to a series of expression that fits into an equation although an equation is a combination of arithmetical expression. <br />
			Questions asked from this topic mainly deals with the arithmetic principles and practical concern. Hence, solution of these problems requires common sense with slight amount of logical reasoning.<br />
			In such type of questions, verbal description of a problem is given where in one or more situations are posed the answer to which can be obtained by the application of arithmetical operations. Such problems are intended to train candidate to think creativity and develop problem solving abilities. </p>

            <p> A bus leaves Delhi with half the number of women as men. At Meerut, 10 men get down and 5 women get in. Now, there are equal number of men and women. How many passengers boarded the bus initially at Delhi?

                <li> 36 </li>
                <li> 45 </li>

                <li> 30 </li>
                </ol>
				<p>
				<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span> <br />
				 Suppose men = 2x <br />
				 and	women = x <br />
				 So,	2x - 10 = x + 5	<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Rightarrow  \) </span> x = 15 <br />
				 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Total number of passengers initially in the bus <br />

            <p> Class A has students twice that of class B. After adding 20 students to class A and 30 students to class B, the total number of students in both the classes is 140.What is the number of students in class A in the beginning? </p>
              <ol class="ordered-list-lower-case">
                <li> 30 </li>
                <li> 60 </li>
                <li> 80 </li>
                <li> 140 </li>
                </ol>
				<p>
				<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span> <br />
			   (b) Suppose the number of students in class A in the beginning = x <br />
			   <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> The number of students in class B in the beginning = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{x}{2}  \) </span> <br />
			   According to the question, <br />
			   <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  (x + 20) + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 30 \right) = 140  \\\\[3pt]
			   \Rightarrow \ \frac{3x}{4} + 50 = 140  \\\\[3pt]
			   \Rightarrow \ \frac{3x}{4} = 140 - 50  \\\\[3pt]
			   \Rightarrow \ x = \frac{90 \times 2}{3} = 60
			    \end{align}  \) </span>
