		  <h4 class="skill-subheading">Pre-Historic Period</h4>
		 <ul>
		 <li>The recent reported artefacts from <span class="highlight01">Bori</span> in Maharashtra suggest the appearance of human beings in India around 1.4 million years ago.</li>
		<li>The early man in India used tools of stone, roughly dressed by crude clipping.</li>
		<li>This period is therefore, known as the Stone Age, which has been divided into <br />
		The Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age <br />
		The Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age <br />
		The Neolithic or New Stone Age</li></ul>
		 <h4 class="skill-subheading">The Palaeolithic Age (500000-9000 BC)</h4>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Palaeolithic men were hunters and food gatherers.</li>
		  <li>They had no knowledge of agriculture, fire or pottery, they used tools of unpolished, rough stones and lived in cave rock shelters</li>
		  <li>They are also called Quartzite men.</li>
		  <li><span class="highlight01">Homo sapiens </span> first appeared in the last phase of this period.</li>
		  <li>This age is divided into three phases according to the nature of the stone tools used by the people and change in the climate.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading">The Mesolithic Age (9000-4000 BC)</h4>
		 <ul>
		  <li>It intervened as a transitional phase between the <span class="highlight01">Palaeolithic Age </span> and the <span class="highlight01"> Neolithic Age. </span></li>
		  <li>In this age, climate became warm and dry which brought about changes in fauna and flora and made it possible for human beings to move to new areas.</li>
		  <li>The Mesolithic people lived on hunting, fishing and food-gathering. At a later stage, they also domesticated animals.</li>
		  <li>The people of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic ages practised painting.</li>
		  <li><span class="highlight01">Bhimbetka </span> in Madhya Pradesh, is a striking site of pre-historic painting.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading">The Neolithic Age (4000-1000 BC)</h4>
		 <ul>
		 <li>The people of this age used tools and implements of polished stone. They particularly used stone axes.</li>
		  <li>It is interesting that in <span class="highlight01">Burzahom </span>, domestic dogs were buried with their masters in their graves.</li>
		  <li>First use of hand made pottery and potter wheel appears during the Neolithic age.</li>
		  <li>Neolithic men lived in caves and decorated their walls with hunting and dancing scenes.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading">The Chalcolithic Age (4500-3500 BC)</h4>
		  <p>The metal implements made by him were mostly the imitations of the stone forms. Copper was the first metal used by men and the culture based on the use of stone and copper tools is called the chalcolithic culture.</p>
