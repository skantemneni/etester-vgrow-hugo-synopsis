            <p> To perform complete work or part of the work requires efforts of person(s) over a period of time. Therefore, the number of persons (P), the quantity of work (W) and period of time taken (T) are important variable in the problems of time and work </p>
             <h3 class="skill-heading" id="02">Some Solving Techniques of Time and Work Problems</h3>
             <p> Time taken (T) to complete a work depends upon the following variables </p>
             <ul>
                 <li> How many persons are engaged in performing the work? </li>
                 <li> How efficient are they? </li>
                 <li> How many hours per day are the workers working? </li>
              </ul>
             <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Important Facts</h4>
             <ul>
                 <li> If a person can do a piece of work in n days, he will do <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{n}  \) </span> of the work in one day. </li>
                 <li> If the number of person doing a piece of job is increased or (decreased) in a certain ratio, the time needed to do the same work will be decreased or (increased) in the same ratio. </li>
                 <li> If A is twice as good as a workman as B, then A take one half of the time taken by B to do a certain piece of work. </li>
                 <li> Wages for a piece of work are paid in proportion to the work done by the workers. <br />
                     If 'm', men or	'n' women can do a piece of work in 'a' days, then x men and y women can do the same work in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{ \frac{x}{ma} + \frac{y}{na}}  \) </span> days. </li>
                 <li> (Some facts for problems on pipes and cistern) If there are two taps A and B takes a h and b h, respectively to fill a tank, then two taps together fill <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} \right )  \) </span> part of the tank in an hour and the entire tank is filled in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{ab}{a + b} h  \) </span>. </li>
                 </ul>
             <h3 class="skill-heading" id="03"> Solved Examples </h3>
               <h4 class="solved-examples-question"> Example 1: </h4>
               <p> Raj can do a piece of work in 20 days and Rohan can do it in 12 days. How long will they take, if both work together?
               </p>
               <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
               <p> <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \because  \) </span> Raj's one day's work = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{20}  \) </span> part <br />
               and Rohan's one day's work = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{12}  \) </span> part <br />
               <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Raj and Rohan's one day's work = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3 + 5}{60} = \frac{8}{60} \ part  \) </span> <br />
               <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Number of days taken by Raj and Rohan together to complete
               the work = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( 1 \div \frac{8}{60} \right ) = \frac{60}{8}  \) </span> days or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  7 \frac{1}{2}  \) </span> days.
               </p>
            <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
            <p> A and B can do a piece of work in 72 days. B and C in 120 days and A and C in 90 days. In what time can A alone do it?
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
            <p> Let A, B and C can do a piece of work in x, y and z days respectively. <br />
            So A's, B's and C's one day's work are <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{x}, \ \frac{1}{y}  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{z}  \) </span> respectively. <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \therefore \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{72} ...... (i)  \\\\[6pt]
                \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{120}......... (ii)  \\\\[6pt]
                and \ \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{90}......... (iii)  \end{align}  \) </span> <br />
            On adding Eqs.(i), (ii) and (iii), we get <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  2 \left ( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} \right ) = \frac{5 + 3 + 4}{360}  \\\\[6pt]
                \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{60} ...... (iv)  \end{align}  \) </span> <br />
            On solving Eqs.(iv) and (ii), we get <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{60} - \frac{1}{120} = \frac{1}{120}  \) </span> <br />
            Hence, A alone will complete the work in 120 days.
             </p>
             <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 3:</h4>
             <p> If 3 men or 4 women can reap a field in 43 days, how long will 7 men and 5 women take to reap it?
             </p>
             <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
             <p> Here, 3 men's work = 4 women's work <br />
             Since, 3 men can reap <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{43}  \) </span> of the field in 1 day </span> <br />
             <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> 1 man can reap <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{129}  \) </span> of the field in 1 day <br />
              Also, 4 women can reap <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{43}  \) </span> of the field in 1 day <br />
             <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> 1 woman can reap <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{172}  \) </span> of the field in 1 day <br />
             <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> 7 men and 5 women can reap <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( \frac{7}{129} + \frac{5}{172} \right )  \) </span> <br />
             of the field in 1 day or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{12}  \) </span> of the field in 1 day. <br />
             Hence, 7 men and 5 women will reap the whole field in 12 days.
             </p>
             <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 4:</h4>
             <p> Two pipes A and B can fill a tank in 36 min and 4 min respectively. A pipe C can empty the tank in 30 min. If all the three pipes are opened simultaneously, then in how much time the tank will be completely filled?
             </p>
             <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
             <p> Part filled by pipe A in 1 min = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{36}  \) </span> <br />
             and part filled by pipe B in 1 min = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{45}  \) </span> <br />
             <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \therefore  \) </span> Total water dropped in the tank in 1 min = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{45}  \) </span> <br />
              Water leaked. out in 1 min by C = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{30}  \) </span> <br />
              <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Total tank filled in 1 min = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{45} - \frac{1}{30}  \) </span> <br />
              = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{4 + 5 - 6}{180} = \frac{3}{180} = \frac{1}{60}  \) </span> <br />
             Hence, the tank will be filled in 60 min or 1 h.
