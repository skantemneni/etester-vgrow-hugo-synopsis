            <p> Time scale is divided into the parts-past, present and future. Past is time that is over, present is running and future is yet to come. Problems usually based on the relationship between ages of persons for two out of three parts of time scale. These relationship are in the form of ratio of their ages or alternatively as number of times of one's age is of the other. <br />
            Sometimes instead of stating the ratio of ages of two persons for two different parts of time scale, only one such relationship is given. </p>
            <p> <i> The other condition is stated in one of the below given form. </i>
            </p>
            <ol class="ordered-list-lower-roman">
                <li> Sum of their ages </li>
                <li> Difference of their ages </li>
                <li> Product of their ages </li>
                </ol>
            <p> The main fact that we have to see that there are two unknowns (i.e., ages of two persons) to be found and hence we must have two unique relationship to solve these problems.
            <h4 class="skill-subheading">Important Facts </h4>
            <ul>
                <li> While solving the question always remember that the given data may be related to present or past or future. </li>
                <li> If ratio between ages of A and B is x : y, then take their ages xk years and yk years, respectively. </li>
                <li> If present age of A is x yr, then t yr ago his age was (x - t) yr and after t yr his age will be (x + t) yr. </li>
                <li> If <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  t_1  \) </span> year ago the age of A was x year, then after <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  t_2  \) </span> years his age will be  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (x + t_1 + t_2) year.  \) </span> </li>
                 </ul>

            <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 1:</h4>
            <p>The ratio of the ages of Ram and Rahim 10 yr ago was 1 : 3. The ratio of their ages 5 yr, hence will be 2 : 3. Then, the ratio of their present ages is
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
            <p>Let 10 yr ago, the ages of Ram and Rahim are x yr and 3x yr respectively. <br />
            According to the given condition, after 5 yr, <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \frac{x + 15}{3x + 15} = \frac{2}{3}  \\\\[6pt]
                \Rightarrow 6x + 30 = 3x + 45  \\\\[6pt]
                \Rightarrow 3x = 15  \\\\[6pt]
                \therefore x = 5 \ yr  \end{align}  \) </span> <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> The ratio of their present ages = x + 10 : 3x + 10 <br />
            = 15 : 25 = 3 : 5
            </p>
           <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
           <p>At present, the ratio of the ages of Maya and Chhaya is 6 : 5 and 15 year from, now the ratio will get changed to 9 : 8. Maya's present age is
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
            <p>Let the present age of Maya and Chhaya are 6x year and 5x yr respectively. <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \frac{6x + 15}{5x + 15} = \frac{9}{8}  \\\\[6pt]
                \Rightarrow 48x + 120 = 45x + 135  \\\\[6pt]
                \Rightarrow 3x = 15  \\\\[6pt]
                \therefore x = 5  \end{align}  \) </span> <br />
            Hence, present age of Maya = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  5 \times 6  \) </span> = 30 years.
            </p>
            <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 3:</h4>
            <p> In a family, the average age of a father and a mother is 35 year. The average age of the father, mother and their only son is 27 year. What is the age of the son?
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
            <p><span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \because  \) </span> Total age of father and mother = 35 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> 2 = 70 years <br />
            and total age of father, mother and son = 27 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> 3 = 81 years <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Age of son = 81 - 70 = 11 years.
            </p>
            <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 4:</h4>
            <p> The average age of 11 players of a cricket team is increased by 2 months, when two of them age 18 years and 20 years are replaced by 2 new players. The average of the new players, is
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
            <p>Let average age of 2 new places = x years <br />
            and average age of 11 players = y years <br />
            According to the question, 11y - 18 - 20 + 2x = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  11 \left ( y + \frac{2}{12} \right )  \) </span> <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \Rightarrow 11y - 38 + 2x = 11y + \frac{22}{12} \Rightarrow 2x = \frac{22}{12} + 38  \\\\[6pt]
                \Rightarrow 2x = \frac{478}{12}  \\\\[6pt]
                \therefore x = \frac{239}{12} = 19 \ years \ 11 \ months  \end{align}  \) </span>
            </p>
