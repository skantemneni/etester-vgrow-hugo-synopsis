            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="01">Average</h3>
            <p> The average of a given set of numbers is equal to the ratio of sum of all numbers and total numbers in the set. Therefore, average of a set of numbers is given by <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Average = \frac{(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ......... + x_n)}{n}  \) </span> <br />
            i.e., Average of given observations <br />
            = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{\text{Sum of all observations}}{\text{Number of observations}}  \) </span> </p>
           <p> <span class="highlight01"> Example: </span> If the age of 4 students are 20 yr, 22 yr, 18 yr and 24 yr, then what is the average age of the students? </p>
            <p> <span class="highlight01">Sol : </span> By the above definition average age <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{20 + 22 + 18 + 24}{4} = \frac{84}{4} = 21 \ yr  \) </span> <br />
            Therefore, average age of 4 students = 21 yr
            </p>
            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="02">Weighted Average</h3>
            <p> The concept of weighted average is used when we have two or more groups whose individual averages are known. <br />
            Suppose in a class, there are 2 students of 20 yr, 3 of 21 yr, 4 of 22 yr and 5 of 23 yr, then their average age is given by <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  = \frac{(2 \times 20) + (3 \times 21) + (4 \times 22) + (5 \times 23)}{2 + 3 + 4 + 5}  \\\\[6pt]
                = \frac{2}{14} \times 20 + \frac{3}{14} \times 21 + \frac{4}{14} \times 22 + \frac{5}{14} \times 23 = \frac{306}{14} yr  \end{align}  \) </span>
            </p>
            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="03">Average Age</h3>
            <p> If the average age of n persons decreases by x yr. Then, the total age of n persons decreases by (n <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> x) yr. Also, if the average age of n persons increases by x yr. Then, the total age of n persons increass by (n <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> x) yr.
            </p>
            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="04">Average Speed</h3>
            <p> If a body travels a certain distance at x <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{km}{h}  \) </span> and the same distance is covered at y <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{km}{h}  \) </span>, then the average speed during whole journey = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{2xy}{x + y} \frac{km}{h}  \) </span>
            </p>

            <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 1:</h4>
            <p>The average age of 6 persons is increased by 2 yr when one of them, whose age is 26 yr is replaced by a new man. What is the age of new person?
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
            <p>Total age increased = 6 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> 2 = 12 yr <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Age of new persons = (26 + 12) = 38 yr
            </p>
           <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
            <p>The average age of 24 boys a teacher is 15 yr. When the teacher's age is excluded, the average decreases by 1. What is the age of teacher?
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
            <p>Total original age of 25 members = 15 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> 25 = 375yr <br />
            Total new age of 24 members = 14 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> 24 = 336 yr <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Age of teacher = (375 - 336) = 39 yr
            </p>
            <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 3:</h4>
            <p> A cricketer has a certain average of 9 innings. In the tenth inning, he scores 100 runs, thereby increasing his average, by 8 runs. Calculate his new average.
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
            <p>Let the average of 9 innings be x runs, hence new average will be (x + 8) runs. <br />
            Total runs scored for 9 innings = 9x. <br />
            Total runs scored for 10 innings = (9x + 100). <br />
            Average for 10 innings = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{Total \ runs}{10}  \) </span> <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Rightarrow (x + 8) = \frac{(9x + 100)}{10} \Rightarrow x = 20  \) </span> <br />
            Therefore, new average = (20 + 8) = 28 runs
            </p>
