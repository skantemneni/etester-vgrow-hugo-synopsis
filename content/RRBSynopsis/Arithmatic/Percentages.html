            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="01">Percent</h3>
            <p> The word percent means per hundred. Thus 21 percent means 21 part out of 100 parts, which can also be written as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{21}{100}  \) </span>. Therefore,  percent is a fraction whose denominator is 100. e.g., <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{21}{100}  \) </span>
            = 21%. </p>
           <p> <i> while dealing with the problems on percentage the following important points are to be remembered. </i> </p>
           <ul>
            <li> To convert a fraction or a decimal or a whole number into a percent, multiply it by 100. </li>
            <li> To convert a percent to a fraction or a decimal, divided it by 100 and delete the % sign. </li>
            <li> When a percent is multiplied by a quantity, then the percentage of the quantity (result) is obtained i.e., p% of N = R. </li>
            </ul>
           <p> <span class="highlight01"> Example </span> </p>
           <p> Quantity of water in milk constitutes 6 parts of every 20 parts of mixture. What is the percentage of water in the mixture? </p>
           <p> <span class="highlight01"> Solution </span> </p>
           <p> Percentage of water in the mixture = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{6}{20} \times 100 = 30 \%  \) </span> </p>
           <p> <span class="highlight01"> Note: </span> To convert  any fraction <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{a}{b}  \) </span> to rate percentage, multiply it by 100 and put % sign. Alternatively to convert a rate per cent to a fraction, divide it by 100 and remove the % sign. </p>
           <h3 class="skill-heading" id="02">Percentage Increase/Decrease </h3>
           <p> Increase or decrease is always in absolute terms whereas percentage increase/decrease is expressed in percentage terms. Hence, percentage increase/decrease is calculated with respect to the base (previous) value unless mentioned otherwise. <br />
           Percentage increase/decrease = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{Increase/Decrease}{Base \ value} \times 100  \) </span> </p>
            <h3 class="Solved-Examples">Solved Examples</h3>
            <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 1:</h4>
            <p>If A's income is 20% more than that of B, then how much percent is B's income less than that of A?
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
           <p> If A's income is R% more than that of B. Then, B's income less than that of A is given by <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = \frac{R}{100 + R} \times 100 = \frac{20}{100 + 20} \times 100 = 16 \frac{2}{3} \%  \) </span>
            </p>
            <p> <span class="highlight01"> Note: </span> This formula is also used for consumption. </p>
            <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
            <p>The wages of a worker is first increased by 20% and subsequently reduced by 20%. If the original monthly wages is Rs.500. What is the final wages?
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
            <p>Final wages = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  500 \times 1.2 \times 0.8 = 500 \times \frac{6}{5} \times \frac{4}{5} = Rs. 480  \) </span> </p>
            <p> <span class="highlight01"> Note: </span> Successive increase/decrease show the successive application of the percentage to a given (original) value. All successive changes in % (increase or decrease) can be represented as a single percentage which is given by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left [ a + b + \frac{ab}{100} \right ] \%  \) </span>. where a and b show the first and second percentage changes. </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Alter </span> With the help of the above rule a single % change can be calculated as <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left [ (+20) + (-20) + \frac{(-20) \times (+20)}{100} \right ] \% = -4 \%  \) </span> <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Final wages = 500 - 20 = Rs. 480 [4% of 500 is 20] <br />
            Here, +ve sign shows the increase and -ve sign shows the decrease.
            </p>
            <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 3:</h4>
            <p>The length of a rectangle is increased by 20% and breadth is decreased by 10%. Calculate the percentage change in the area.
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span><br />
            Percentage change in area <br />
            = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( a + b + \frac{ab}{100} \right ) \% = \left ( 20 - 10 - \frac{200}{100} \right ) \% = 8 \%  \) </span>

            <h5 class="Note"> Note </h5>
            <ul>
                <li> If a quantity is increased by r% then final quantity (after increase) is obtained by multiplying the original quantity by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( \frac{100 + r}{100} \right )  \) </span> </li>
                <li> If a quantity is decreased by r% then final quantity (after decrease) is obtained by multiplying the original quantity by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( \frac{100 - r}{100} \right )  \) </span> </li>
