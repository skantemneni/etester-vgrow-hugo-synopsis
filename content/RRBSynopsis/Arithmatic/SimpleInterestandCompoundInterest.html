            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="01">Interest</h3>
            <p> If we borrow money from a bank, then we return the sum after sometime with some extra money. This extra amount paid is known as interest. <br />
            There are two types of interest </p>
            <ol class="ordered-list-decimal">
            <li>	Simple Interest </li>
            <li>	Compound Interest </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <h4 class="skill-subheading">Simple Interest </h4>
            <p> If on a sum borrowed for a certain period, interest is reckoned uniformly, interest is called simple interest. </p>
            <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Important facts </h5>
            <ul>
                <li> The amount borrowed is called principal or sum denoted by P. </li>
                <li> Extra amount is interest denoted by I. </li>
                <li> Time for which amount is borrowed is denoted by T. </li>
                <li> Amount = Principal + Interest </li>
                <li> Simple Interest (SI) = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}  \) </span> </li>
            </ul>
             <h4 class="skill-subheading">Compound Interest </h4>
             <p> If the principal does not remain the same for the entire loan period, due to addition of interest to the principal after a certain interest of time to form the new principal, then the interest obtained is called compound interest. </p>
             <h4 class="skill-subheading">Important Formulae (Rules) </h4>
             <ul>
                <li>	Consider P = Principal (amount borrowed) <br />
                    A = Amount (principal + interest) <br />
                    T = Time <br />
                    R = Rate of interest <br />
                    n = Number of time for which interest is calculated. <br />
                    <span class="highlight01"> When interest is compounded annually </span> <br />
                    <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Amount = P \left ( 1 + \frac{R}{100} \right )^n  \) </span> <br />
                    <span class="highlight01"> When interest is compounded half-yearly </span> <br />
                    Here, as interest would be calculated after every six months. <br />
                    Then, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n = T \times 2 \ and \ rate = \frac{R}{2}  \) </span> <br />
                    So, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  A = P \left ( 1 + \frac{ \frac{R}{2}}{100} \right )^n  \) </span> <br />
                    when rate of interest are different for different years say <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R_1 \%, \ R_2 \%, \ R_3 \%  \) </span> for first, second and third year respectively, then amount <br />
                    <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  A = P \left ( 1 + \frac{R_1}{100} \right ) \left ( 1 + \frac{R_2}{100} \right ) \left ( 1 + \frac{R_3}{100} \right )  \) </span>
                    </li>
                <li> If A and B are the amounts of a certain sum for two consecutive year, then simple interest for 1 yr = B - A </li>
                </ul>
             <h5 class="note">Note</h5>
             <ul>
                 <li> When interest is compounded yearly, then on the same sum and at the same rate, then <br />
                     Compound interest for the 1st year = Simple interest for the 1st year </li>
                 <li> If the difference between the simple interest and compound interest on the same sum Rs. P at r% per annum for 2 yr is Rs. d, then <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  d = P \left ( \frac{r}{100} \right )^2  \) </span> </li>
                 <li> If the difference between the SI and CI on the same sum Rs.P at r % per annum for 3 yr is Rs.d then <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  d = \frac{P \times r^2 \times (300 + r)}{(100)^3}  \) </span> </li>
                 </ul>

               <p> Total interest needed in a year <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Rs. 400 \times 12 = Rs. 4800  \) </span> <br />

            <p>A person takes a loan of Rs. 10000 partly from a bank at 8% per annum and remaining from another bank at 10% per annum. He pays a total interest of Rs.950 per annum. Amount of loan taken from the first bank ( in Rs) is

            <p>  Let, amount of loan taken from the first bank be Rs.x <br />
