            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="01">Cost Price (CP)</h3>
            <p> The cost price of an article is the price at which the article is bought <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  CP = SP \times \frac{100}{100 + P \%}  \) </span> [In case of profit] <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  CP = SP \times \frac{100}{100 - L \%}  \) </span> [In case of loss]
            </p>
            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="02">Selling Price (SP)</h3>
            <p> The selling price of an article is the price at which the article is sold. <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  SP = CP \times \frac{(100 + P \%)}{100}  \) </span> [In case of profit] <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  SP = CP \times \frac{(100 - L \%)}{100}  \) </span> [In case of loss]
            </p>
            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="03">Profit or Gain</h3>
            <p> If selling price of an article is more than its cost price, there is profit or gain. <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Profit \ percent = \frac{SP - CP}{CP} \times 100  \) </span> <br />
            Profit = SP - CP
            </p>
            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="04">Loss</h3>
            <p> If selling price of an article is less than its cost price (CP), there is loss. <br />
            In fact, <br />
             Loss = CP - SP <br />
             <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Loss \ percentage = \frac{CP - SP}{CP} \times 100  \) </span>
            </p>
            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="05">Marked Price</h3>
            <p>While selling goods, traders add a certain percentage in the cost price. This addition to the cost price is called the mark up price and this mark up value added to cost price is called the marked price. <br />
            Therefore, <br />
            Marked price = CP + Mark up price <br />
            Now, the seller may sell the product on the marked price. <br />
            In such case, <br />
            Marked price = Selling price <br />
            He may also sell the product after allowing a discount on the marked price. <br />
            In such case, <br />
            Selling price = Marked price - Discount

            <h3 class="Solved Examples"> Solved Examples </h3>
               <h4 class="solved-examples-question"> Example 1: </h4>
               <p> A person sells an article for a price which gives him a profit of 20% on cost price of Rs. 500. Calculate the selling price of the article. </p>
               <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
               <p> <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  SP = CP + profit  \\\\[6pt]
                   = CP + 20 \% \ of \ CP  \\\\[6pt]
                   = 500 \left ( 1 + \frac{20}{100} \right )  \\\\[6pt]
                   = \frac{500 \times 120}{100} = 500 \times 12  \\\\[6pt]
                   = Rs. 600  \end{align}  \) </span> <br />
               <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Selling price of the article = Rs. 600
              </p>
            <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
            <p> A person marks his goods 20% more than the cost price and allows some discount on it. He still makes a profit of 10%. Find the discount percentage.
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
            <p> Let the CP of the article be Rs. 100. <br />
            Then, MP of the article = Rs. 120 <br />
            Since,	profit = 10% <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> SP = CP + Profit = 100 + 10 =  Rs. 110 <br />
            The difference between marked price and selling price is the discount. <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Discount = MP - SP = 120 - 110 = Rs. 10 <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( Discount \ percentage = \frac{Discount}{Marked \ Price} \times 100 = \frac{10}{120} \times 100 = 8.33 \%  \) </span>
            </p>
            <h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 3:</h4>
            <p> By selling two articles for Rs.180 each a shopkeeper gains 20% on one and looses 20% on the other, find the percentage profit / loss
            </p>
            <p><span class="highlight01">Solution:</span></p>
            <p> Let cost price of two articles are Rs. x and Rs. y, respectively. <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \therefore  80 = \frac{x \times (100 + 20)}{100}  \\\\[6pt]
                \Rightarrow x = \frac{180 \times 100}{120} = 150  \\\\[6pt]
                and \ 180 = \frac{y \times (100 - 20)}{100}  \\\\[6pt]
                \Rightarrow y = \frac{180 \times 100}{80} = 225  \end{align}  \) </span> <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Total cost price = 150 + 225 = Rs. 375 <br />
            and total selling price = 180 + 180 = Rs. 360 <br />
            Hence,	loss = 375 - 360 = Rs. 15 <br />
            <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore loss \ percent = \frac{15}{375} \times 100 = 4 \%  \) </span>
            </p>
            <h5 class="note">note</h5>
                <p> In cases, where the selling price of two articles is same and one is sold at the loss of x% and another is sold at a profit of x%. Or in other words, the profit % and loss % is same and selling price is same. This transaction always yields a loss and such loss % = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( \frac{common \ loss \ or \ gain \%}{10} \right )^2  \) </span>
                </p>
