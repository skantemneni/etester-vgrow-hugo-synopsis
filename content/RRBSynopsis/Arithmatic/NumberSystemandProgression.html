            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="01">Number System</h3>
            <p> A number system is a set of numbers include real numbers, natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, irrational numbers, even numbers and odd numbers. </p>
            <h4 class="skill-subheading">Natural Numbers </h4>
            <p> Natural numbers i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... are used for counting. It may be noted that <br />
            	+1 is the smallest natural number.
            </p>
            <h4 class="skill-subheading">Whole Numbers </h4>
            <p> The number '0' together with the counting numbers (natural numbers) gives us the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,.... These numbers are called as whole numbers. It may be noted that </p>
            <ul>
            	<li> Each natural number is a whole number. </li>
                <li> 0 is the smallest whole number. </li>
                </ul>
            <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Important Facts </h5>
            <ul>
                <li> The largest natural number and the largest whole numbers are indeterminable. </li>
                <li> The successor of a whole number is 1 more than that of whole number. </li>
                <li> The predecessor of a whole number is 1 less than that of whole number. </li>
                <li> All whole numbers can be matched with points on the number ray. </li>
                </ul>
            <h3 class="skill-heading" id="02">Integers</h3>
            <p>The set of numbers ..., - 5, - 4, - 3, - 2, - 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... are called as integers.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Integers (except 0) are either positive or negative. </li>
                <li> The absolute value of an integer is its numerical value regardless of its sign. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
           <h3 class="skill-heading" id="03">Rational Numbers</h3>
           <p> A number of the form <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{p}{q}  \) </span>, where p and q are integers and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q \neq 0  \) </span> is called a rational number. <br />
             Every integer is a rational number and every fraction is a rational number. </p>
             <h3 class="skill-heading" id="04">Irrational Numbers</h3>
             <p> A number is irrational if and only if its decimal representation is non-terminating and non-repeating. </p>
             <ul>
             <li>Rational numbers and irrational numbers taken together form the set of real numbers. </li>
             <li>If a and b are two real numbers, then either <br />
                 <ol class="ordered-list-lower-roman">
                     <li> a > b or </li>
                     <li> a = b or </li>
                     <li> a &lt; b. </li>
                     </ol>
                 This is also called law of trichotomy. </li>
                <li> Negative of an irrational number is an irrational number </li>
                </ul>
             <h5 class="skill-smallheading">Important facts </h5>
             <ul>
                 <li> The sum of rational number with an irrational number is always a "irrational number". </li>
                 <li> The product of non-zero rational with an irrational number is always an irrational number. </li>
                 <li> The sum of two irrational numbers are not always an irrational number. </li>
                 <li> The product of two irrational numbers are not always an irrational number. </li>
                 <li> The sum (or difference) of a rational and an irrational number a irrational. </li>
                 <li> The product of a rational and an irrational number is irrational. </li>
                 </ul>
             <h3 class="skill-heading" id="05">Real Numbers</h3>
             <p> The totality of all rational and irrational numbers form the set of real numbers. Thus, every natural number, every whole number, every integer, every rational number and even irrational number is a real number. </p>
             <h4 class="skill-subheading">Even and Odd Numbers </h4>
             <p> Integers divisible by 2 are known as even numbers, while which are not divisible by 2 are known as odd integers. </p>
             <h4 class="skill-subheading">Prime Numbers </h4>
             <p> A number greater than one is called a prime number, if it has, exactly two factors, namely one and itself. </p>
             <ul>
               <li> There are 25 prime numbers between one and hundred. </li>
               <li> 2 is the smallest prime number and only even number which is prime. </li>
               </ul>
             <h4 class="skill-subheading">Composite Numbers </h4>
             <p> Number greater than 1 which are not prime, are known as composite numbers. 1 is a factor of every number and is the only number which is neither prime nor composite. </p>
             <h3 class="skill-heading" id="06">To Find the Unit's Place Digit in the Product of Numbers </h3>
             <p> First take unit's place of each number. Find the product of digits. If there is any ten's place digit, then take unit's place to continue the product. Then, the unit's place digit in the last number is required digit. <br />
             e.g., Unit's place digit in 568 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> 723 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> 864 <br />
             = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  [ (.....8 \times .....3) \times ...... 4 ] = [(....4) \times (....4)] = .....6  \) </span> </p>
             <h3 class="skill-heading" id="07">To Find the Unit's Place Digit in the Number of Index Form </h3>
             <ul>
                 <li> If there is 0, 1, 5 or 6 are the given numbers at unit's place, then it will be unaltered. <br />
                     Unit's place digit of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (576)^{1151} = ... 6  \) </span> and <br />
                     Unit's place digit of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (131)^{156} = 1  \) </span> </li>
                 <li> If unit's place of digit is 3, then solve the expression as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( 3^4 = 1  \) </span> <br />
                     e g . <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (353)^{158}  \) </span> <br />
                     <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  = (353)^{156} \times (353)^2 = ( ....3^4)^{39} \times (...3)^2  \\\\[6pt]
                         = (...1)^{39} \times (...9) = (...1) \times (...9) = 9  \end{align}  \) </span>
                     </li>
                 <li> If unit's place of digit is 9, then unit's place of the digit must be, 1 when power is even otherwise it must be 9. e.g., In <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (349)^{241}  \) </span>, since 241 is an odd number, hence the unit's place of it must be 9. </li>
                 <li> If unit's place of digit is 7, then <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (7^4) = 1  \) </span> gives the solution. <br />
                     e.g., <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (3127)^{173}  \) </span>, unit's place must be <br />
                     = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  (...7^4 )^{173} = (...7^4 )^{43} \times (...7)^1  \\\\[6pt]
                         = (...1)^{43} \times (...7) = (...7)  \end{align}  \) </span>
                     </li>
                 </ul>
             <h3 class="skill-heading" id="08"> Division On Numbers </h3>
             <p> Let D and d are two numbers, then <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{D}{d}  \) </span> is called the Operation of division, where D is the dividend and d is divisor. A number which tells how many times a divisor (d) exists in dividend D is called the quotient Q. Thus, <br />
             Dividend = (Divisor <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> Quotient) <br />
             If dividend D is not a multiple of divisor d, then D is not exactly divisible by d and in this case remainder R is obtained. Thus, <br />
             Dividend = (Divisor <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> Quotient) + Remainder <br />
             <i> If p divides q and r, then p divides q <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \pm  \) </span> r also. </i>
             </p>
             <h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Important Facts </h5>
             <ul>
                 <li> When <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  x^n + k  \) </span> is divided by (x - 1), then remainder is <br />
                     <ul>
                         <li> 1 + k, when k &lt; (x - 1) </li>
                         <li> 1 + p, when k &gt; (x - 1), where p is the remainder obtained by dividing k by (x - 1). </li>
                         </ul>
                     </li>
                 <li> If N is a composite number of the form N = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( a^P, \ b^q, \ c^r  \) </span>, where a, b and c are primes, then the number of divisors of N represented by m is given by m = (p + 1) (q + 1)(r + 1). </li>
                 </ul>
             <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Divisibility </h4>
             <p> Testing divisibility of a large number by a given divisor is time consuming process, if we do it by performing actual division. Also, there is no well defined general rule to test the divisibility of numbers. Test of divisibility may be derived from the properties of multiples of specific divisors. </p>
             <ul>
                 <li> A number formed by repeating a digit six times will be divisible by 7, 11 and 13. e.g., 888888. </li>
                 <li> A number formed by repeating a two digit number three times, will be divisible by 7. e.g., 323232. </li>
                 <li> A number formed by repeating a three digit number two times, will be divisible by 7, 11 and 13. e.g., 632632. </li>
                 <li> If a number is divisible by two co-prime numbers a and b then N is also divisible by ab. </li>
                 </ul>
