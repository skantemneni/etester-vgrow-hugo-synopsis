         <h3 class="skill-heading" id="01"> Mechanics </h3>
		 <p> In Physics, we study about a large number of physical quantities, which can be broadly classified into two categories : scalars and vectors. </p>
		 <h4 class="skill-subheading">Scalar Quantities</h4>
		 <p>Physical quantities which have magnitude only. e.g., Mass, speed, volume. work, time, power, energy etc are scalar quantities. </p>
		 <h4 class="skill-subheading">Vector Quantities</h4>
		 <ul>
		 <li> Physical quantities, which have magnitude and direction both, e.g.. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, momentum, torque etc. </li>
		<li> For a quantity to be a vector it is necessary that it follows the triangle rule of addition of two vectors. </li>
		<li> Moment of inertia, pressure, refractive index, stress are tensor quantities.</li>
		</ul>
		  <h3 class="skill-heading" id="02"> Newton's Laws of Motion</h3>
		  <p> <span class="highlight01"> First Law: </span> Every body maintains its initial state of rest or motion with uniform speed on a straight line unless an external force acts on it. It is also called <span class="highlight01"> Galileo's law or law of inertia. </span> <br />
		  While jumping from a slowly moving train/bus one must run for a short distance, in the direction of motion.<br />
		  <span class="highlight01"> Second Law: </span> The force acting on an object is directly proportional to the product of the mass of the object and the acceleration produced on it.<br />
		  <span class="highlight01"> Third Law </span> To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br />
		  Bogies of the trains are provided with buffers to avoid severe jerks during shunting of trains.<br />Rocket moves up due to reaction of downward ejection of gas. </p>
		  <h3 class="skill-heading" id="03">Circular Motion</h3>
		  <ul>
		  <li> When an object moves along a circular path, its motion is called circular motion. </li>
		  <li> The direction of motion at any point in circular motion is given by the tangent to the circle at that point. </li>
		  <li> The external force required to act radially inward over the circular motion of the body is called Centripetal force. </li>
		  <li> Cream separator, centrifugal dryer work on the principle of centrifugal force. </li>
		  <li> In the death well, the walls of well exert an inward force over the motorcycle and as a reaction, the motorcycle exert an outward force on the walls of the well. </li>
		  <li> Centrifugal force is such a pseudo force that is equal and opposite to centripetal force. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3 class="skill-heading" id="04"> Friction </h3>
		  <p>It is the opposing force that is set-up between the surface of contact, when one body slides or rolls or tends to do so on the surface of another body.</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li> Due to friction we are able to move on the surface of Earth </li>
		  <li> While applying brakes in automobiles, it stops only due tc friction. </li></ul>
		  <h3 class="skill-heading" id="05">Work</h3>
		  <ul>
		  <li> Work is said to be done, if force acting on a body is able to actually move it through some distance in the direction of the force. Its unit is a joule.<br />
		  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  Work = FS \ cos  \theta ,  \\\\[3pt]
          Where, \ \ \ \ F = force, \ S = \ displacement  \\\\[3pt]
          Where, \ \theta  \end{align}  \) </span> <br />
		  is  the  angle  between the direction of force and displacement.</li>
		  <li> <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  If \ \theta > 90^\circ},  \) </span> then work will be negative. </li>
		  <li> <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  If \ \theta < 90^{\circ},  \) </span> then work will be Positive. </li>
		  <li> <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  If \ \theta = 90^{\circ},  \) </span> then work will be zero. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3 class="skill-heading" id="06"> Energy </h3>
		  <p> Capacity of doing work by a body is called its energy. Energy is a scalar quantity and its unit is <span class="highlight01"> Joule. </span> Mechanical energy is two types. <br />
		  If a coolie carrying a load on his head is moving on a horizontal cratform, then theoretically he is not doing any work because <br />
		  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \theta = 90 {\circ}, \ W = FS cos 90^{\circ} = 0  \) </span> </p>
		  <ul>
		  <li> <span class="highlight01"> Kinetic Energy (K) </span> Energy possessed a body has by virtue of its motion <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  K = \frac{1}{2} {mv}^2  \) </span> where, m is mass and v is the velocity.</li>

		  U = mgh <br />
		  m is mass, ffg is acceleration to gravity, h is height.
		  </li>
		  <li> The sum of all kinds of energies in an isolated system remains constant at all times. This is the law of conservation of energy. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3 class="skill-heading" id="07"> Power </h3>
		  <p> Rate of doing work is called power. Its unit is <span class="highlight01"> watt. </span> <br />
		  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Power = \frac{Work \ done}{Time \ taken}  \) </span> </p>
		  <ul>
		  <li> 1 watt hour = 3600 joule </li>
		  <li> 1 kilowatt hour = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3.6 \times {10}^6  \) </span> joule </li>
		  <li> 1 HP = 746 watt </li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3 class="skill-heading" id="08"> Gravitation </h3>
          <ul>
		  <li> Everybody in the universe attracts other body by a force called force of gravitation.</li>
		  <li> The gravitational force of the earth is called <span class="highlight01"> gravity. </span> </li>
		  <li> The acceleration produced in a body due to force of gravity is cailed <span class="highlight01"> acceleration </span> due to gravity (g) and its value is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  9.8 \ \frac{m}{s^2}.  \) </span> </li>
		  <li> Acceleration due to gravity is independent of shape, size and on mass of the body. </li>
		  <li> Escape velocity is the minimum velocity with, which an object just crosses the Earth's gravitational field and never returns. Escape velocity at the Earth's surface is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  11.2 \frac{Km}{s}.  \) </span> </li>
		  <li> Escape velocity at the Moon's surface is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2.4 \frac{km}{s}.  \) </span> Due to low escape velocity there is no atmosphere on the moon.</li>
          </ul>
		  <p> Value of g decreases with height or depth from Earth surface.<br />
          g is minimum at poles. <br />
		  g is minimum at equator. <br />
		  g decreases due to rotation of Earth. <br />
		  g decreases if angular speed of Earth increases and increases if gular speed of Earth decreases. <br />
		  The acceleration due to gravity at the moon is one - sixth that of Earth. So, the weight of a person on the surface of the moon. </p>
		   <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Satellites </h4>
		  <ul>
		  <li> Satellites are natural or artificial bodies revolving around a planet under its gravitational force of attraction. </li>
		  <li> <span class="highlight01"> Moon </span> is a natural satellite, while INSAT - B is an artificial satellite of Earth. </li>
		  <li> The period of revolution of satellite revolving near the surface of earth is 1 hour 24 minutes (84 minutes). </li>
		  <li> Geo-stationary satellite revolves around the Earth at a height of 3600 km. The orbit of geo-stationary satellite is called parking orbit. </li>
		  <li> Geo-stationary satellite revolves in equatorial plane from West to East. Time period of rotation of geo-stationary satellite is <span class="highlight01"> 24 h. </span> </li>
		  <li> The <span class="highlight01"> Earth </span>  rotates on its axis from <span class="highlight01"> West to East.</span> This rotation makes the Sun and the stars appears to be moving across the sky from East to West. </li>
		  <li> Geo-stationary satellite is used to reflect TV signals and telecast TV programmes from one part of the world to another in weather forecasting in predictions of floods and droughts. </li>
		  <li> <span class="highlight01"> Polar Satellite </span> Revolves around the earth in polar orbit at a height of <span class="highlight01"> 800km </span> (app.) Time periods of these satelites is <span class="highlight01"> 84 min. </span></li>
		  <li> These are used for weather forecasting, mapping etc. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3 class="skill-heading" id="9"> Waves </h3>
		  <p> A wave is a disturbance, which propagates energy from one place to the other without the transportation of matter. <br />
          Waves are broadly of two types </p>
		  <ol class="ordered-list-decimal">
		  <li> Mechanical wave (longitudinal wave and transverse wave) </li>
		  <li> Electromagnetic wave. </li>
		  </ol>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Longitudinal Waves </h4>
          <p> In this wave the particles of the medium vibrate in the direction of propagation of wave. <br />
		  Waves on springs or sound waves in air are examples of longitudinal waves. </p>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Transverse Waves </h4>
          <p> In this wave the particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave. <br />
		  Waves on strings under tension, waves on the surface of water are the examples of transverse waves. </p>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Electromagnetic Waves </h4>
          <ul>
		  <li> The waves, which do not require medium for their propagation i.e., which can propagate even through the vacuum are called electromagnetic waves. </li>
		  <li> Light radio waves, X-rays etc are the examples of electromagnetic waves. These wave propagate with the velocity of light. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Sound Waves </h4>
          <p> Sound waves are longitudinal mechanical waves. Based on their frequency range sound waves are divided into following categories. </p>
		  <ul>
		  <li> The sound waves which lie in the frequency range <span class="highlight01"> 20 Hz to 20000 Hz </span> are called audible waves. </li>
		  <li> The sound waves having frequencies less than <span class="highlight01"> 20 Hz </span> are called infrasonic. </li>
		  <li> The sound waves having frequencies greater than 20000 Hz are called ultrasonic waves. </li>
		  <li> Ultrasonic waver are used for sending signals, measaring the depth of sea, cleaning clother and marhinery parts of closks, remaning lamp short from chamney of factories and in ultrasonography. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3 class="skill-heading" id="10"> Speed of Sound </h3>
          <ul>
          <li> Speed of sound is maximum in solids and minimum in gases. </li>
		  <li> When sound goes from one medium to another medium, its speed and wave length changes, but frequency remain unchanged. </li>
		  <li> The speed of sound remains unchanged by the increase or decrease of pressure. </li>
		  <li> The speed of sound increases with the increase of temperature of the medium. </li>
		  <li> The speed of sound is more in humid air than in dry air because the density of humid air is less than the density. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <p> <span class="highlight01"> Echo </span> The repetition of sound due to reflection of sound waves, is called an echo. </p>
		  <p> <span class="highlight01">Intensity </span> It is defined as amount of energy passing mornalhy perunit area held around that point per unit time. </p>
		  <p> <span class="highlight01"> Pitch </span> It is that characteristics of sound her a grave sound. </p>
		  <p> <span class="highlight01"> Sonar </span> It stands for sound navigation and ranging. It is used to measure the depth of a seam to locate the enemy submarines and shipwrecks. </p>
		  <h3 class="skill-heading" id="11"> Doppler's Effect </h3>
		  <ul>
		  <li> If there is a relative motion between source of sound and observer, the apparent frequency of sound heard by the observer is different from the actual frequency of sound emitted by the source. This phenomenon is called <span class="highlight01"> Doppler's effect. </span> </li>
		  <li> When the distance between the source and observer decreases, then apparent frequency increases and vice-versa </li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3 class="skill-heading" id="12"> General Properties of Matter </h3>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Elasticity </h4>
          <p> Elasticity is the property of material of a body by virtue of which the body acquires its original shape and size after the removal of <span class="highlight01"> deforming force. </span> </p>
          <ul>
		  <li> A force, which changes the configuration of a body, is called a <span class="highlight01"> deforming force. </span> </li>
		  <li> Steel is more elastic than rubber. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Pressure </h4>
		  <p> Pressure is defined as force acting normally an unit area of the surface pressure = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{Force}{Area}, \ Its \ unit \ is \ \frac{N}{m^2}.  \) </span> It is a scalar quantity. </p>
		  <ul>
		  <li> Atmospheric pressure is measured by an instrument called the barometer. </li>
		  <li> Sudden fall in barometric reading is the indication of storm. </li>
		  <li> Slow fall in barometric reading is the indication of rain. </li>
		  <li> Slow rise in the barometric reading is the indication of clear weather. </li>
		  <li> The pressure exerted by liquid column at the surface given as p = hdg, where d is the density of liquid h is height of liquid column. </li>
		  <li> In a static liquid at same horizontal level, pressure is same at all points. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Pascal's Law of Pressure </h4>
		  <p> If gravitational attraction is negligible in equilibrium condition, pressure is same at all points in a liquid. <br />
		  Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude. <br />
		  That is why </p>
		  <ul>
		  <li> It is difficult to cook on the mountain. </li>
		  <li> The fountain pen of a passenger leaks in aeroplane. </li>
		  <li> Bleeding occurs from the nose of the man. </li>
		  <li> It is difficult to breath on higher altitude due to less amount of air. </li>
		  <li> Water starts to boil below <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  100^{\circ} C.  \) </span> </li>
		  </ul>
		  <p> The pressure exerted anywhere at a point of confined liquid is transmitted equally and undiminished in all directions throughout the liquid.<br />
		  Hydraulic lift, hydraulic press and hydraulic brakes are based on the Pascal's law of pressure. </p>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Surface Tension (T) </h4>
		  <ul>
		  <li> It is the forece (F) acting normally an unit length (l) of imaginary line drawn on the surface of liquid i.e., <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  T = \frac{F}{l}  \) </span> </li>
		  <li> Its unit is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{N}{m}.  \) </span> </li>
		  <li> The surface tension decreases with rise in temperature and becomes zero at the critical temperature. </li>
		  <li> Due to the surface tension, rain drops are spherical in shape. </li>
		  </ul>
          <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Archimedes' Principle </h4>
		  <p> When a body is immersed partly or wholly in a liquid, there is an apparent loss in the weight of the body, which is equal to the weight of liquid displaced by the body. </p>
		  <ul>
		  <li> The weight of water displaced by an iron ball is less than its own weight. Whereas water displaced by the immersed portion of a ship is equal to its weight. So small ball of iron ball sink in water, but large ship float. </li>
		  <li> A fat person will quickly learn the swimming as compared to a slim person because he will displace more water. So, will be more balanced. </li>
		  <li> Hydrogen filled ballon float in air because hydrogen is lighter than air. </li>
		  <li> A person can lift more weight in water. </li>  </ul>
          <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Laws of Floatation </h4>
		  <p> A body floats in a liquid if </p>
		  <ol class="ordered-list-decimal">
		  <li> The density of material of body is less than or eq to the density of liquid. </li>
		  <li> The density of material of body is equal to density of liquid, the body floats fully submerged in liquid in neutral equilibrium, when body floats in neutral equilibrium the weight of the body is equal to the weight of displaced liquid. </li>
		  <li> When body floats in neutral equilibrium, the weight of the body is equal to the weight of displaced liguid. The centre of gravity of the body and centre of gravity of the displaced liquid should be in one vertical line for the condition. </li>
		  </ol>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Density </h4>
		  <ul>
		  <li> Density is defined as mass per unit volume. </li>
		  <li> Relative density is measured by hydro-meter. </li>
		  <li> The density of sea water is more than that of normal water. </li>
          <li> The density of iron is more than that of water, but less than that of mercury. So, a solid chunk of iron sink in water but float in mercury. </li>
		  <li> If ice floating in water in a vessel melts, the level of water in the vessel does not change. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Surface Tension </h4>
		  <ul>
		  <li> The property of a liquid by virtue of which it tries to minimise its free surface area is called the surface tension.</li>
		  <li> Surface tension decrease with rise in temperature and become zero at the critical temperature. </li>
		  <li> The surface tension of clean water is higher than that of a soap solution. </li>
		  <li> Formation of lead shots, spraying result in coldness, floatation of needle on water, dancing of camphor on water, are based on surface tension. </li>
		  <li> Rain drop from spherical shape due to surface tension. </li>
		  <li> When kerosene oil is sprinkled on water, its surface tension decreases, due to which the excess of mosquitoes floating on e surface of water die due to sinking. </li>
		  </ul>
          <h3 class="skill-heading" id="13"> Cohesive and Adhesive Forces </h3>
		  <p> Force of attraction applied between molecules of same substance is called <span class="highlight01"> cohesive force </span> while attractive force between molecules of different substance is called <span class="highlight01"> adhesive force. </span> </p>
		  <ul>
		  <li> A piece of bloating paper soaks ink because the pores of the blotting paper serve as capillary tubes. </li>
		  <li> The oil in the wick of a lamp rises due to capillary action of threads in the wick. </li>
		  <li> The root hairs of plants draws water from the soil through capillary action. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <p> When a ship enters in a see from a river it raise a bit because the density of saline water is higher. </p>
		   <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Capillarity </h4>
		  <p> The phenomenone of rise or depression of liquids in a capillary is called capillarity. </p>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Viscosity </h4>
		  <p> Viscosity is the property of a fluid by virtue of which an internal de onal force acts between its layers, when it is in motion. </p>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Bernoulli's Theorem </h4>
		  <p> When an incompressible and non-viscous liquid (or gas) flows eamlined motion from one place to another, then at every point of its path the total energy per unit volume (pressure energy) + kinetic energy + potential energy) is constant. <br />
		  Venturimeter, Bunsen's Burner, Atomizer, filter pump, motion of aeroplane are based upon the Bernoulli's theorem. </p>
		  <h4 class="skill-subheading"> Simple Pendulum </h4>
		  <ul>
		  <li> Simple pendulum is a heavy point mass suspended from a rigid support by means of an elastic and inextensible string. </li>
		  <li> The maximum time period of a simple pendulum is 84.6 min. The time period of a simple pendulum does not depend upon the mass, shape and size of the bob and its amplitude of oscillation. A pendulum clock goes slow in summer and fast in winter. </li>
		  <li> If a simple pendulum is suspended in a lift descending down with acceleration, then time period of pendulum will increase. If lift is ascending, then time period of pendulum will decrease. If a lift falling freely under gravity, then the time period of the pendulum is infinite. </li>
		  </ul>
	      <h3 class="skill-heading" id="14"> Heat and Temperature </h3>
