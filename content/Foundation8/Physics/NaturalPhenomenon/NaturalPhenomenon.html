	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>In nature there are some destructive phenomena. We have to know that how can we protect ourselves from these destructive phenomena. In this chapter we will discuss two destructive natural phenomena such as lightning and earthquakes.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Types of electrical charges and their properties</h4>
		<p>Everything around us is made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of electrons, protons and neutrons. Electrons have a negative charge (-) and protons have a positive charge (+). Neutrons are neutral because they have no charge. Atoms normally have equal numbers of electrons and protons. When two materials are rubbed together, electrons from the atoms of one material may be transferred to the other. An atom that loses electrons becomes positively charged. When an atom gains extra electrons, it becomes negatively charged.</p>

		<p>When charged objects are brought together, they will experience a kind of force called electrostatic force. Objects with the same type of charges repel each other. Objects with different types of charges attract each other. Thus, like charges repel and unlike charge, attract.</p>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Conductors</h5>
		<p>The substances which have a very large number of free electrons, such that they can be made drift cn the application of electric potential are called conductors. <br />
			Eg: All metals, graphite, acid solutions in water, alkali solutions in water and metallic salt solutions in water are good conductors.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Insulators or Bad conductors</h5>
		<p>The substances which which do not have very large number of free electrons, such that they cannot be made to drift on the application of electric potential, are called insulators or bad conductors. <br />
			Eg: All gases are bad conductors. Most of the organic compounds, such as alcohol, ether, benzene, chloroform, sugar, starch, fur, rubber, plastic, sealing wax, silk, etc., are bad conductors. Glass, mica, asbestos are worst conductors.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Charging by Rubbing</h5>
		<p>Rub a plastic ruler with a piece of cloth and bring it near some small pieces of paper. The pieces of paper are attracted to the ruler because the ruler is charged. The charges produced in the ruler is known as static electrical charges. Electrostatics is the study of static electrical charges.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Flow of charge</h5>
		<p>When a negatively charged conductor is connected to a positively charged conductor, the electrons move from the negative to the positive. In other words, the electric current flows from the negative to the positive.</p>

	<p>An electroscope is a device used for detecting the presence of:</p>

				<p>an electric charge on a body.</p>

			<li>
				<p>in comparing charges on two or more different bodies.</p>

	<p>This instrument also gives a rough estimation of the quantity of electricity present on different bodies.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Lighting conductors</h4>
		<p>A lightning conductor is made of copper and has sharp points of platinum.It is connected to the earth by means of a thick copper strip running down the building and terminating buried copper plate. <br />
			As we know, the electric  charge gradually leaks from a pointed ends, therefore, an electric wind steams off from the points of the lightning conductor towards the charged cloud. There by forming a conducting path. When the electrically charged wind racthe the cloud,all the from the charge in the clouds flows down the conducting path and strikes the  lightning conducter.This charge then flows down through the copper strip into the earth. Thus, the building gets protected.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Do not stand underneath a natural lighting rod such as a tall, isolated tree.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Avoid projecting above the surrounding landscape as you would do if you were standing on a hilltop, in an open field, on the beach or fishing from a small boat.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Get out of and away from open water.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Get away from tractors and other metal farm equipment.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Get off of and away from motorcycles, scooters, golf carts and bicycles. Put down golf clubs.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Stay away from wire fences, clotheslines, metal pipes, rails and other metallic paths which could carry lightning to you from some distance away.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Avoid standing in small isolated sheds or other small structures in open area.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Earth Quakes</h4>
		<p>Sudden shaking or trembling of the earth lasting for a short time is called earthquakes. It is caused by the disturbance of inner layers of the earths crust.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Causes of an earth quake </h5>
		<p>The outermost layer of the earth is not in one piece. It is fragmented. Each fragment is called a plate. If plate move a plate goes under another due to collision. They cause disturbance in the earth's crust. This disturbance that show up as an earthquake on the surface of the earth.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Measurement of power of earth quake</h5>
		<p>The power of an earthquake is expressed in terms of a magnitude on a scale called Richter scale. The tremors produced waves on the surface of the earth. These are called seismic waves. The waves are recorded by an instrument is called seismograph.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Precautions against Earthquakes</h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">If you are at home</h5>
		<p>Take shelter under a table and stay there till shaking stops.<br />
			Stay away from tall and heavy objects that may fall on you.<br />
			If you are in bed, do not get up. Protect your head with a pillow.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">If you are outdoors</h5>
		<p>Find a clear spot, away from buildings, trees and overhead power lines. Drop to the ground. <br />
			If you are in a car or a bus, do not come out. Ask the driver to drive slowly to a clear spot. do not come out till the tremors stop.</p>
