		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Demonstration of vibration of tuning fork</h4>
		<p>Tuning fork is a 'U' shaped rod made of a certain metal with a stem to hold. Take a tuning fork (T) and fix its stem on the base of a stand. Suspend a light pith ball (B) so as to touch the tuning fork. Strike the fork with rubber hammer. Then the pith ball which is suspended, by a thread is thrown away and set to vibrate briskly. This shows that the prongs of the tuning fork is under vigorous vibration. If the vibrating tuning fork is placed laced near our ear, we can hear the sound produced by it. Therefore mechanical energy is made to produce sound. Thus sound is a form of energy produced by vibrating bodies.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Classification of sound</h3>
	<p>We cannot sense the sounds produced by all vibrating bodies. For example, we cannot sense the sound produced by a vibrating pendulum. This is because the frequency of the pendulum is very less. We will be able to sense the sounds having frequencies from 20Hzto20,000Hz. <br />
		Based on frequency, waves can be classified as : </p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Audible range</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Infrasonic and</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Ultrasonics</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Audible range</span>
		<br />
		The range of frequencies that people with normal hearing can detect is called the audible range.<br />
		The highest frequency that humans can hear is the upper limit of your hearing. For young people this is usually between 16000 and 20,000 hertz. There is also a lower limit. This is about 20 hertz.<br />
		Thus, "the hearing range or the range of human audibility is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz".<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Infrasonic Sound</span>
		<br />
		Some vibrations produce sounds below the normal hearing range. These are known as infrasonic sounds (below 20 Hz). Earthquakes, underground nuclear explosions, and tides, all produce infrasonic sounds. These sounds, although they cannot be heard by humans, can be detected by a device called a seismometer.<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Ultrasonic Sound</span>
		<br />
		Vibrations above the normal hearing range produce ultrasonic sounds (above 20,000 Hz).<br />
		Many animals like bats, dolphins, dogs, produce and hear such sounds. For example, humans can hear only part of the high-pitched squeak of the mouse. The mouse squeak is also made up to ultrasonic sounds which can be heard by a hunting cat.<br />
		Many forms of animal life depend on ultrasonic sound for their survival.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Application</h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Investigation of structure of Matter</h5>
		<p>Sending ultrasound through bulk of matter and studying the variation in their velocity inside it, valuable information regarding the constitution of complex molecules can be obtained.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Cleaning</h5>
		<p>Dirty odd shaped parts, spiral tubes, electronic components are placed in a cleaning solution and ultrasonic waves are passed through it. Due to high frequency vibrations particles of dirt get detached and drop out. The objects are thoroughly cleaned.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Detection of flaws (Cracks) in Metals</h5>
		<p>Ultrasound is sent through the metallic structure. They pass through unobstructed structure if the structure is homogeneous. In case of a crack inside the structure the ultrasound will be reflected back towards observer and received. Existence of reflection, confirms existence of a crack. Due to high frequency and short wavelength, even fine cracks can be detected.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Depth of Seas and Oceans</h5>
		<p>Ultrasound oscillator producing waves of frequency 40 kHz is provided inside ships. An ultrasound receiver is also provided inside the ship.<br />
			The transmitter oscillator transmits the waves towards bottom and reflected waves are received by the receiver. A recorder finds the time interval (t). Knowing velocity (v) of ultrasound through sea water, the depth (d) can be calculated as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  d = \frac{vt}{2}  \) </span>
			<br />
			A similar mini arrangement can be used for finding the depth of liquid level in a tank without opening its cover.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Sound Ranging</h5>
		<p>A special equipment called Sonar is used for this purpose.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Emulsions of Immiscible Liquids</h5>
		<p>When a strong beam of ultrasound is passed through a liquid, it is heated to a very high temperature. This fact is utilized in preparing homogeneous stable emulsion of immiscible liquids. Ultrasound treated honey does not crystallize.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Medical and Biological Effects</h5>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>When ultrasound is passed through a body part having muscular pain or rigid joints, their high frequency vibrations produce soothing effect and relieve the pain.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Ultrasound sent through brain cures a mental patient.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>A newly developed technique of three dimensional photographs with the help of ultrasound (ultrasonography) is being used by the physicians to locate the exact position of an eye tumour and its removal giving normal vision to the patient.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Reflection of sound</h3>
	<p>When a wave going from one medium comes back to the same medium after striking the second medium, reflection of the wave is said to take place. Sound wave also suffer reflection like light waves. The reflection of sound can be demonstration as follows:<br />
		Take a drawing board and fix it on the floor. Put two metallic or cardboard tubes. These tubes are making some angle with each other. Put a clock near the end of one tube and a screen between the two tubes so that sound of clock may not be heard directly by the ear placed infront of the second tube. The second (like tick-tick) waves pass through the tube are reflected by the drawing board. The reflected sound waves enter the second tube and are heard by the ear placed infront of the second tube.<br />
		Go on adjusting the position of the second tube. A stage will come when the
		loudness of the sound heard through the second tube is maximum. At this stage, the incident angle <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \angle{i}  \) </span> = reflected angle <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \angle{r}  \) </span> , which is the law of reflection.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Applications of Reflection of Sound </h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Megaphone</h5>
		<p>Megaphone is a device used to address public meetings. It is horn-shaped. When we speak through megaphone, sound waves are reflected by the megaphone. These reflected sound waves are directed towards the people without much spreading.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Hearing Aid</h5>
		<p>Hearing aid is used by a person who is hard of hearing. The sound waves falling on hearing aid are concentrated into a narrow beam by reflection. This narrow beam of sound waves is made to fall on the diaphragm of the ear. Thus, diaphragm of the ear vibrates with large amplitude. Hence, the hearing power of the person is improved.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Sound Boards</h5>
		<p>Sound boards are curved surfaces (concave) which are used in big hall to direct the sound waves towards the people sitting in a hall. The speaker is placed at the focus of the sound board.<br />
			Sound waves from the speaker are reflected by the sound board and these reflected waves are directed towards the people.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Sonar</h3>
	<p>Another application of reflection of sound in Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR). The process of locating the position of objects submerged in water e.g., submarines and icebergs, by the reflection of sound from them is called echo depth sounding. It is also used for finding the depth of the sea. The instrument used for this purpose is called SONAR.<br />
		A sonar consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter is the source of ultrasonics. With the help of crystals that can be made to vibrate electrically, ultrasonics of frequency upto 1000 MHz can be produced.<br />
		The ultrasonic waves from the transmitter travel under water in all directions. When they strike an object they are reflected. The receiver receives the reflected ultrasonic waves from the object. It records not only the reflected waves but also the time 't' taken by them to travel from the ship and back from the object.<br />
		Knowing the speed 'v' of sound waves in water <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (V_{water} = 1500 \ ms^{-1})  \) </span>, the depth of the vt
		object is found using the relation, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  h = \frac{vt}{2}  \) </span>
		<br />
		The sonar not only indicates the distance of the object, but also its approximate direction.</p>
