	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>An electric bell, a motor or a generator used in our daily life works on the principles based on the electromagnetism. Electro magnetism is one of the branch of physics which deals with the magnetic effects produced by a current carrying conductor.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">	Magnets</h3>
	<p>Magnets are solid objects of stone, metal or other materials which have the property of attracting certain substances like iron. This attracting property is either natural or induced. The phenomenon of attracting magnetic substances like iron, nickel, cobalt etc., is called magnetism.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Properties of magnets</h4>
		<p>The properties of magnets are.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Attractive property</h5>
		<p>Magnets possess the property of attracting small pieces of a objects made of metal like iron, steel, nickel and cobalt. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Magnetic material </span>
			<br />
			Substancee which are easily attracted by a magnet are called magnetic substances. <br />
			Example: Iron, steel, nickel and cobalt. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Non-magnetic material </span>
			<br />
			Substances which are not attracted by a magnet are called non-magnetic substances.<br />
			Example: Copper, brass, paper, plastic, wood, etc.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Directive property</h5>
		<p>Suspend a magnet by a thread attached to a wooden stand push the magnet. The magnet will comes to rest in north-south direction. This property is called directive property.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Like poles repel and unlike poles attract</h5>
		<p>If two magnets are brought neai.er such that two north poles face each other or two south poles face each other, they repel one another. On the other hand a north and a south pole always attract one another.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Poles exists in pairs</h5>
		<p>If a magnet is broken into two parts, instead of obtaining separate N-pole and S-pole, each of the two parts is found to possess both the polarities, that is, each piece is still a magnet. <br />
			The new ends formed at the place where the magnet is cut acquire polarities opposite to what the ends of the pieces possess.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Properties of magnets</h4>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Permanent magnets</h5>
		<p>Magnets made from substances such as hard-steel and certain alloys which retain their magnetic properties over a long of time are called permanent magnets.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Temporary magnets</h5>
		<p>The magnets which retain their magnetism only under certain conditions like presence of strong magnets or an electric current in the vicinity are called temporary magnets.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Testing a magnets</h5>
		<p>A magnet attracts a piece of iron as well as the opposite pole of another magnet. Therefore, an object cannot be identified as a magnet simply because it is getting attracted towards a magnet. It could just be a piece of iron. <br />
			However, if the object is repelled by a magnet, then it must also be a magnet, since only like poles of two magnets repel. <br />
			Thus, repulsion and not attraction, is the sure test for polarity of a magnet. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">The Earth as a Magnet (Terrestrial Magnetism)</h4>
		<p>The Earth behaves like a huge magnet with its north pole near the geographic South pole and south pole near the geographic North pole. This is the reason why a freely suspended magnet comes to rest in the north - south direction. The north pole of the suspended magnet is attracted by the south pole of the Earth's magnet, and hence points to the geographic north.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Compass</h5>
		<p>A compass consists of a needle-shaped magnet which can rotate freely on a pivot. The needle always rests in the north - south direction. <br />
			Compasses help hikers, sailors and soldiers to find their way.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>An electromagnet is made by winding a coil of wire around a soft iron core.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Soft iron and not steel is used as the core because soft iron loses its magnetism when the current is switched off. Steel retains its magnetism and becomes a permanent magnet.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The strength of an electromagnet increases <br />
						significantly with the use of soft iron core. <br />
						when the number of turns per unit length of the coil is increased. <br />

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Electric Bell</h5>
		<p>Electric bell is based on the principle of an electromagnet, "a temporary strong magnet acquires magnetic properties when an electric current flows through it, and loses its magnetic properties as soon as the current is stopped".</p>

		<p>If the current flows always in the same direction, it is called a direct current. <br />

			The direction of the circular magnetic field can be determined by the right hand grip rule. Use your right fist to grip the wire with your right thumb pointing the direction of the current. The direction of your four fingers will indicate the direction of the circular magnetic field. Only choice D shows the possible orientation of the compass needles caoccordmg to the right-hand grip rule. In this case the Earth's magnetic field causes the npass needles to align not exactly perpendicular to the current carrying wire.</p>
