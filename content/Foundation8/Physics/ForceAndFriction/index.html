					<p>Mass is the amount of substance contained in a certain object. Substance that makes up an object is known as matter. Hence mass is the quantity of matter.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The mass of an object can be measured by using a beam balance or a level balance.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The unit of mass is kilogram (kg), the smaller units are gram (g) and milligram (mg).<br />

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In outer space where there is no gravitational force, an astronaut will experience weightlessness, where his body has no weight although his body's mass remains the same.<br />

	<p> Friction is nothing but a force which appears between two surfaces in contact and resists the motion of one body over another body.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Definition </h4>
		<p> A force arising when one body slides over the surface of another body such that it is directed opposite to the motion of the body, is called friction.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Causes of friction </h4>
		<p>When two surfaces are in contact with each other. Their surfaces appear to be smooth to naked eye. But when seen under a powerful microscope, surface appears with a number of depressions and elevations.<br />
			The force of friction arises because of interlocking of the depressions of one surface with elevations of the other. The direction of frictional force is always opposite to the direction of motion of an object.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Types of friction </h4>
		<p> There are two types of friction. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">1. Static friction</h5>
		<p> The friction that exists between the surfaces in contact when there is no relative motion is called friction <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Limiting friction </span>
			<br />
			The maximum frictional force present when a body just begins to slip over the surface of another body is called the maximum static friction or force of limiting friction. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">2. Dynamic friction</h5>
		<p> It is the friction experienced by a body, when it is in motion. The dynamic friction is also called kinetic friction and is less than the static friction. <br />
			It includes </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Sliding friction <br />
						The friction that exists between two surfaces in contact when the body slides on the surface is known as the sliding friction. <br />
						Example <br />
						Movement of skies on the snow.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Rolling friction <br />
						The friction that exists between two surfaces when the body rolls on the surfaces when the body rolls on the surface is known as rolling friction. It is denoted by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( f_R .  \) </span>
						<br />
						Magnitude of rolling friction is much less than that of sliding friction. <br />

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Friction by liquids and Gases</h4>
		<p> Gases and liquids also exerted a friction on the bodies moving through them. <br />
			Examples <br />
			When an object or body falls from some height through air, air exerts a force of friction to oppose this motion. <br />
			The bodies of aeroplanes, automobile etc., are designed to reduce the effect of air friction. <br />
			We cannot walk on river as freely as we walk on land. Because water exerts much larger friction.<br />
			The shape of boats and submarines are designed to reduced the friction exerted by water.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Friction is a necessary Evil</h4>
		<p> If there is no friction between any two surfaces in contact, then the present day civilization will be no more as we cannot even walk properly on the earth. <br />
			There will be no fabrics and garments, no construction of buildings and no furniture, even no cooking and no vehicles. <br />
			So friction is necessary. But too much friction causes a heavy loss of energy, wear and tear of machinery. <br />
			Thus, the efficiency of machines will decrease tremendously. So it is right said that friction is a necessary evil. </p>

			Why horse has to pull the cart harder during first few steps of motion? </p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The limiting friction is more than the dynamic friction. During the first few steps, the cart is moving slowly and limiting friction operates.<br />
