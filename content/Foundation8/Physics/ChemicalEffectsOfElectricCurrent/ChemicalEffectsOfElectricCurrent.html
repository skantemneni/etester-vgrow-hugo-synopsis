	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>IWhen electric current passes through some conducting fluids, chemical action takes place at the electrodes. This effect is known as chemical effect of electrical current. The passage of an electric current through a conducting solution causes chemical reactions. As a result any of the following activities can be observed.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Electrolysis</h3>
	<p>When electricity is passed through some substances they decompose such process is called electrolysis.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Electrolysis of Water</h4>
		<p>The process of splitting liquid water into its two component gases is called electrolysis of water. <br />
			Chemically water is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen gas. It is stable compound and cannot be separated into hydrogen and oxygen on heating or other process than electrolysis on passing electric current in impure water, water splits up into its component gas, hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
