	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>We are quite familiar with the importance of light. The objects are seen when there is light while nothing is visible in darkness. Light itself is not visible but in the presence of other objects it becomes visible.<br />
		Thus, light is the external physical cause that affects the eye to produce the sensation of vision.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">General definitions related to Light</h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Luminous bodies</h5>
		<p>An object that emits its own light is called a luminous object. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			Sun, stars, glow worm, a burning candle and electric lights.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Non luminous bodies</h5>
		<p>An object that does not give out its own light but becomes visible when light from a luminous objects falls on it is called a non-luminous object.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			Moon, earth, book and table etc.,</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Optical Medium</h5>
		<p>The term medium is used for any substance through which light might pass. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			Glass, water, air etc.,<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Transpatent medium</span>
			<br />
			substances that allow most of the light to pass through them are called transparent substance. We can see through them clearly. A transparent substance is called an optical medium.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			Glass, water, air etc.,<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Translucent medium</span>
			<br />
			Substances which allows only apart of the light to pass through it and through which object cannot be distinctly seen. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			Butter paper, paraffin wax, greased paper, ground glass etc.,<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Opaque medium</span>
			<br />
			Opaque object is one that does not allow any light to pass through it. They reflect or absorb all the light that falls on them. We cannot see through them. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			Wood, stone, rubber, walls, books etc.,</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Homogenous Medium</h5>
		<p>An optical medium which has uniform composition, throughout is called homogenous medium.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			Glass, diamond distilled water, a sheet of clear plastic, vacuum, pure alcohol etc.,</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Heterogenous Medium</h5>
		<p>An optical medium which has different composition at different points is called heterogeneous medium.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			Air, muddy water, fog, mist, smoke of clouds etc., </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Point source of light</h5>
		<p>If a screen with a pin hole is placed infront of a lighted bulb then a point light is obtained. From the point source, light propagates uniformly in all directions.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">A ray</h5>
		<p>Light from a point source spreads out in all directions. The directions of a very narrow path of light is known as a ray of light.<br />
			A ray of light is represented by a straight line with an arrow head. The arrow head on it gives the direction of light.<br />

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Beam of light</h5>
		<p>A collection of rays of light is called a beam of light. A beam of light is classified three kinds viz. parallel beam of light, convergent beam of light, divergent beam of light. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Parallel beam of light</span>
			<br />
			These rays of light are parallel to each other such that the distance between th remains same. Light from distant objects gives a parallel beam of light. the rays

			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br /> 
			In order for the eye to see the maximum reading and the minimum reading, the eyes must look at the two extreme ends of the 30 cm mirror. The diagram below makes uses of the fact that angle of incidence = angle of reflection to show the range that can be seen by the eye through the mirror. Take note that if the observer and the object is at the same perpendicular distance away from the mirror, the image seen through the mirror is twice as much as the size of the mirror. For this case, a 30 cm mirror can see a range of 60 cm.</p>
