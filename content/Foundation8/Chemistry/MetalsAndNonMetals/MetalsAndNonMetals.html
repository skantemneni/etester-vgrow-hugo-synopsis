	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>All matter in the nature is made from only a few elements. These elements are made up of smallest particles called atoms that display properties of that element. Hence, every element displays a definite set of properties. Yet, elements have their properties either similar or different from one another. Based on this elements can be classified mainly into metals and non-metals apart from a group of elements having both characters of metals and non-metals generalised as metalloids.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="02">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Metals</h3>
	<p> Metal is an element which can form a positive ion by losing electrons. Hence they are also known as electropositive elements. <br />
		eg: Al, Cu, Fe, Zn etc.,</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">	Occurrence of Metals</h3>
	<p>Metals can occur both in free and combined states.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Free state</h4>
		<p>When a metal is found in free state, then it is in uncombined state. <br />

			<br />
			Gold, Silver, Platinum</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Combined state</h4>

<section class="skill" id="04">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Non-Metals</h3>
	<p>Non-metal is an element which can form a negative ion by gaining electrons. Hence they are also known as electronegative elements. <br />

		<p>Usually, metals are shiny, but articles like aluminium kettle, copper utensils or iron pipes are not very shiny. Why?<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			We see that aluminium kettle, copper utensils or iron pipes are dull and not very shiny. This is due to the fact that there is a formation of a thin film of oxide, carbonate or sulphide on the surface of metals. But when they are rubbed with sand paper, the shining metallic lustre is visible.</p>

		<p>Why do metals acquire a dull appearance on exposure to air for a long time?<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			The metals form a protective coating of metal carbonates or metal sulphides on reaction with the moisture of air, which makes the metals appear dull.</p>
