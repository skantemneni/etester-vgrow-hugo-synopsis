	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>A fibre is a thread or a filament from which cloth is made. If synthesized by humans, it is known as synthetic fibre and if obtained from plants and animals it is known as natural fibre. The materials which are obtained from natural or artificial sources, by weaving or knitting the fibres are called fabrics. For example, the clothes which we wear are made up of fabrics. Eg: cotton, wool etc., [natural fabrics]. Most of the synthetic fabrics are also made from coal and petrol. The components of coal or natural gas are heated to very high temperature under high pressure, which results in conversion of these components as starting materials for many fabrics.</p>

			<br />
			PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and polystryene; polythene. </p>

			First completely synthetic substance - Bakelite <br />
			As Bakelite is poor conductor of electricity, it is used for making electrical switches, handles of utensils etc., <br />
			Melamine resists fire and tolerates heat better than other plastics. Hence, it is used in making floor tiles, kitchen ware and fabrics.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Advantages</h4>
		<p>Plastics are non reactive and do not conduct electricity. <br />
			Plastics are light, strong and durable. <br />
			They are light, price is low, good strength and easy to handle. <br />
			Hence used in aircraft, cars, spacecrafts, making slippers, furniture, decoration pieces etc.,</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 1:</h4>
		<p>Ram wants to buy cotton shirts for summer. The whole family is happy and wanted to buy the same. Are they correct in their choice? Give reason.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			Cotton absorbs moisture and sweat. As a result, when we sweat more in summer the Sweat is not trapped between the fabric and the skin. Sweat keeps on evaporating from the fabric and we feel our skin can breath. Hence their choice of clothes is absolutely right.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
		<p>Rayon is not considered as a synthetic fibre completely. Justify the statement.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			In the true sense or literally rayon is not considered as a synthetic fibre completely because, it involves the regeneration of cellulose from natural resources, in the synthesis, to improve the quality of fibre. Hence it is also called as modified natural fibre.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 3:</h4>
		<p>Is terylene a type of polyester? Explain.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			Polyester is light weight and strong. Terylene, as it is very elastic, used in making conveyor belts. Polyester under the name 'mylar' is used in making recording tapes in audio, video cassettes and floppy disks.</p>

		<p>The thermal conductivity of plastics is very poor. Justify the statement giving examples.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			APlastics are very poor conductors of heat. Hence, they are used for making handles of cooking containers. In refrigerators (as plastic foam core) to prevent heat from outside from entering inside. As containers in micro waves.</p>
