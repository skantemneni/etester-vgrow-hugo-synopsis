	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>From the dawn of creation, the world has been subjected to the escapable phenomenon called change. In fact, the only thing which is permanent perhaps, is change. Change is inexorable law of nature. It has manifested itself in every branch of human activity. Chemistry is that branch of science which deals with the reactions of various substances and the resulting changes. They range from very simple ones like change in state, colour, volume etc, to the more complex interconnecting reactions that keep our bodies alive.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading" id="02">Physical Change</h3>
	<p>The process where a change is occurring only in physical properties, without affecting the identity of the molecules is called a physical change. <br />
		In a physical change, the chemical composition remains the same and the original substances can be regenerated by reversing the conditions. <br />
		Hence, physical change is a temporary change. <br />

		<br />
		Melting of ice, Melting of Wax </p>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Homogeneous Reaction</h5>
		<p>If all the reactants and products in a chemical reaction are in the same physical state, then the reaction is said to be a homogenous reaction. Same physical state means that all of them are in gaseous state or in liquid state or in solid state. <br />

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Irreversible Reaction</h5>
		<p>A reaction that occurs only in one direction, i.e., from reactants to products, is called an irreversible reaction. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			The reaction of quicklime with water to form hydrated lime is an irreversible reactions. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \underset{\underset{(Quick \ lime)} {Calcium \ oxide}}{CaO}(s) + \underset{Water}{H_2O}(l) \rightarrow  \underset{\underset{(hydrated \ lime )}{Calcium \ hydroxide}}{Ca(OH)_2}  + Heat  \) </span>
			<br />
			Similarly, burning of natural gas is an irreversible reaction. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{methane}{CH_4}(g) + \underset{oxygen}{2O_2}(g) \rightarrow  \underset{carbon \ dioxide}{CO_2}(g) + \underset{water \ vapour}{2H_2 O}(g)  + Heat  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Reversible Reaction</h5>
		<p>A reaction that occurs in both directions is called a reversible reaction. The reactant change to products and simultaneously products change to reactants. The reactants and products achieve a state of equilibrium with one another. <br />
			A reversible reaction is represented by two half - arrows between the reactants and products. One half - arrow points from reactants towards products and the other half arrow points in the opposite direction.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Nitrogen}{N_2}(g) + \underset{Hydogen}{3H_2}(g)   \rightleftharpoons    \underset{Ammonium}{2NH_3}(g)  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Decomposition Reaction</h5>
		<p>A reaction in which a compound decomposes into two or more elements or compounds is known as a decomposition reactions. When limestone is strongly heated, it decomposes into quick lime (calcium oxide) and carbon dioxide.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Calcium \ carbonate}{CaCO_3}(s) \ \rightarrow  \underset{Calcium \ oxide}{CaO}(s) +    \underset{Carbon \ dioxide}{CO_2}(g)  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Combination Reaction</h5>
		<p>A reaction in which two or more elements or compounds combine to form a single compound is known as a combination reaction. When hydrogen and chlorine gases (elements) are allowed to mix in sunlight, they combine to form a single compound - hydrogen chloride gas.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Hydrogen }{H_2}(g) + \underset{Chlorine}{Cl_2}(g) \rightarrow \underset{Hydrogen \ chloride \ gas}{2HCl}(g)  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Displacement Reaction</h5>
		<p>A chemical reaction in which one element displaces another element from a compound is known as a displacement reaction. It is also called substitution reaction. The common types of displacement reactions are as follows. <br />
			An active metal displaces hydrogen from a dilute acid. If a piece of zinc metal is dipped in dilute hydrochloric acid, it displaces hydrogen from the acid. Hydrogen is released as a gas.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Zinc }{Zn}(s) + \underset{Hydrochloric \ acid}{2HCl}(aq) \rightarrow \underset{Zinc \ chloride}{ZnCl_2}(aq) +  \underset{Hydogen}{H}(g)  \) </span>
			<br />
			Similarly other metals also displace hydrogen from acids.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Double Displacement Reaction</h5>
		<p>A reaction in which two compounds interchange their ions or radicals to form two new compounds is known as a double displacement reaction. If we add dilute hydrochloric acid to a solution of silver nitrate, a white precipitate of silver chloride is formed.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Hydrochloric \ acid}{HCl}(aq) + \underset{Silver \ nitrate}{AgNO_3}(aq) \rightarrow \underset{Silver \ chlorid}{AgCl}(s) +  \underset{Nitric \ acid}{HNO_3}(aq)  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   H^+  \) </span> ion of hydrochloric acid has been taken by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   NO_3^-  \) </span> radical of silver nitrate forming nitric acid, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   C1^-  \) </span>  ion of hydrochloric acid has been taken up by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   Ag^+  \) </span> ion of silver nitrate forming silver chloride precipitate. The two compounds have thus interchanged their ions and radicals to form two different compounds.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Neutralisation Reaction</h5>
		<p>A reaction in which an acid and a base react with each other to form a salt and water is called a neutralisation reaction. <br />
			Hydrochloric acid reacts with calcium hydroxide (base) to form calcium chloride (salt) and water.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Hydrochloric \ acid}{2HCl}(aq) + \underset{Calcium \ hydroxide}{Ca(OH)_2}(aq) \rightarrow \underset{Calcium \ chlorid}{CaCl_2}(aq) +  \underset{water}{2H_2O}(I)  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Precipitation Reaction</h5>
		<p>A reaction in which a precipitate is formed is called a precipitation reaction. A precipitate is an insoluble product that separates out as solid particles at the bottom of the solution. <br />
			If we add a few drops of dilute hydrochloric acid to a solution of silver nitrate, a white precipitate of silver chloride is formed.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Hydrochloric \ acid}{HCl}(aq) + \underset{Silver \ nitrate}{AgNO_3}(aq) \rightarrow \underset{Silver \ chlorid}{AgCl}(s) +  \underset{Nitric \ acid}{HNO_3}(aq)  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Oxidation Reaction</h5>
		<p>A chemical reaction in which there is gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen is called an oxidation reaction.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			When magnesium ribbon burns in oxygen, it forms magnesium oxide. Since oxygen has been added to magnesium, the reaction is said to represent oxidation of magnesium. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Magnesium}{2Mg}(s) + \underset{Oxygen}{O_2}(g) \rightarrow \underset{Magnesium \ oxide}{2MgO}(s)  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Reduction Reaction</h5>
		<p>A chemical reaction in which there is gain of hydrogen or loss of oxygen is called a reduction reaction.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			Consider the reaction between hydrogen and chlorine gases. If a mixture of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Cl_2  \) </span> gases are kept in sunlight, it reacts instantaneously to form hydrogen chloride gas. Since chlorine gains hydrogen, the reaction represents reduction of chlorine.<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Hydogen}{H_2} (g) + \underset{Chlorine}{Cl_2}(g) \rightarrow \underset{Hydrogen \ chloride }{2HCl}(g)  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Redox Reaction</h5>
		<p>In a chemical reaction, whenever one substance is oxidised, another substance is reduced.This means that oxidation and reduction reactions always occur simultaneously.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Hydogen}{2H_2} (g) + \underset{Oxygen}{O_2}(g) \rightarrow \underset{water}{2H_2O}(I)  \) </span>
			<br />
			Consider the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. Here hydrogen gains oxygen, so it is oxidation reaction. And oxygen gains hydrogen, so it is reduction reaction. Similarly, consider the reaction between iron oxide and carbon monoxide to form iron and carbon dioxide. Since iron oxide loses oxygen, it is undergoing reduction while carbon monoxide gains oxygen, it is undergoing oxidation reaction.<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Iron \ oxide}{Fe_2 O_3} (s) + \underset{Carbon \ monoxide}{3CO}(g) \rightarrow \underset{Iron}{2Fe}(s) + \underset{Caarbon \ dioxide}{3CO_2}(s)   \) </span>
			<br />
			We see that every oxidation reaction is also a reduction reaction and vice versa. Hence, the chemical reactions involving reduction and oxidation are called redox reactions.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Oxidizing agent</h4>
		<p>Substances that help in oxidation of other substances are known as oxidising agents For example, in the reaction <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   ZnO + C \rightarrow Zn + CO  \) </span>
			<br />
			'C' undergoes oxidation by gaining 'O' from ZnO. That is, ZnO helps C to get oxidised by giving oxygen. Hence, Zn is the oxidising agent. <br />
			Similarly, oxidising agents also gain electrons or hydrogen and help the other substances to get oxidised.</p>

		<p> Why is hydrogen placed in the metal reactivity series, though it is not a metal?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br/>
			Hydrogen is placed in the metal reactivity series, since it shows the following properties of metals: <br />
			Hydrogen atom has one electron in its valence shell and it readily loses its electron to form a positive ion like metals. Hence, hydrogen is placed in metal reactivity series.</p>

		<p>When a piece of copper is dipped in silver nitrate solution, formation of a white silvery compound is observed. Explain.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			When a piece of 'Cu' is dipped in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  AgNO_3  \) </span> solution, 'Cu' disappears and a white silvery compound settles down. This process can be represented as, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Cu + 2AgNO_3 \rightarrow 2Ag \downarrow + Cu(NO_3)_2  \) </span>
			<br />
			As copper (Cu) is present above silver (Ag)  in reactivity series, it is more reactive than Ag. <br />
			Therefore, 'Cu' loses electrons more easily than 'Ag' and displaces 'Ag' from silver nitrate <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (AgNO_3)  \) </span> solution, forming copper nitrate <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (Cu(NO_3)_2)  \) </span> and metallic silver (Ag) which settles down as a white compound. </p>

			We know that a more reactive metal replaces a less reactive metal from its salt solution. The reactivity series is as follows:</p>

		<p>A substance X undergoes a chemical change involving the loss of Hydrogen and this results in the formation of a product Y. What type of agents are X and Y?(Reducing agent or Oxidising agent)</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			We know that, oxidising agent undergoes reduction and reducing agent undergoes oxi¬dation. Hence, we need to know whether the substance has undergone oxidation or reduction. As X undergoes a chemical change by losing hydrogen atom, it is undergoes oxidation. Hence, it is a reducing agent. To the product Y, hydrogen is added, it undergoes reduction. Hence, Y acts as an oxidising agent.</p>

			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			It is to be noted that the substance that undergoes oxidation is said to be oxidised and the substance that undergoes reduction is said to be reduced. As A loses 2 electrons, it undergoes oxidation and hence is oxidised. <br />

		<p>Which are more stable - products of Exothermic and Endothermic reactions? </p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			The stability of molecules depends upon the energy content of the molecule. The molecules containing less energy are relatively more stable than the molecules containing more energy. <br />
			In an endothermic reaction, heat is absorbed and the product molecule has more energy, making it less stable; in an exothermic reaction, energy is released and the product molecules have less energy than the reactant molecules, making them more stable. <br />
			Thus, an exothermic reaction yields more stable products.</p>

		<p>What type of reactions are Respiration and Photosynthesis - Endothermic or Exothermic?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			The process of respiration - An exothermic process: <br />
			Combustion reactions are reactions where substances burn to produce flame. There are a few reactions where no flame is evident. But all these are exothermic reactions. The most important of these is the crucial biochemical reaction - respiration - that which releases energy in cells. <br />
			Respiration takes place in all living things. The respiratory reaction is: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + energy  \) </span>
			<br />
			The process can be further explained as follows: <br />
			We breathe air containing oxygen into our lungs, where it passes into thousands of air sacs (alveoli). These air sacs provide a very large surface area of membranes. Oxygen diffuses through the membranes into the blood where it improves haemoglobin in RBC. Thus oxygen is carried by the blood into millions of cells of the body. Respiration takes place in each of these cells where glucose reacts with oxygen to produce carbondioxide and water. During this process, energy is given out. Hence, this reaction can be called exothermic reaction. The energy given out supports many other cell reactions and keeps our heart and muscles working. The carbon dioxide and water return into the blood and eventually we breathe them out. <br />
			The process of photosynthesis - An endothermic reaction: <br />
			Heat is not the only form of energy that can break bonds and start chemical reactions. Some chemical reactions are affected by light energy. Life on this planet would be impossible without these photochemical reactions. <br />
			Photosynthesis proceeds as in following reaction:<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  6CO_2 + 6H_2O   \xrightarrow[Chlorophyll]{+sunlight(energy)} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2  \) </span>
			<br />
			The Photosynthesis process, in which plants prepare their food, is the other way round of respiratory process. <br />
			Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts of the green leaves of plants. Plants take carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil and prepare glucose. This process utilizes the light energy of the Sun trapped by chlorophyll, the green pigment in the leaves. In this process, as energy is absorbed in the form of light, the reaction can be called an endothermic reaction. <br />
			Within the plants, glucose first gets converted into starch. Then the carbon atoms are used to build proteins and the other complex compounds needed for life.</p>
