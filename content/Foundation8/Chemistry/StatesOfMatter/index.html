	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Everything that we see around us is matter. A book, a table, a chair you are sitting on, the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe, the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars and everything else. <br />
		Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. Chemistry is a branch of science which deals with the study of matter. But all the matter we observe have different shapes, colours etc. The difference in these properties which is explained on the basis of kinetic molecular theory of matter. </p>

	<p>Matter exists mainly in three physical states - solid, liquid and gas.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Kinetic Molecular Theory of Matter</h3>
	<p>The theory, which visualizes that any substance, whether solid, liquid or gas, is made up of atoms, molecules or ions in constant motion, is called the Kinetic Molecular Theory of matter. </p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Postulates of the kinetic molecular theory </h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Composition of matter</h5>
		<p>Matter is composed of small particles, which may be atoms, ions or molecules. The constituent particles of a given substance are identical in all respects. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Arrangement of particles</h5>
		<p>These particles have spaces lying between them, and these spaces are referred to as intermolecular spaces. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Force of attraction</h5>
		<p>The force of attraction between the molecules of a given substance is called intermolecular force. The magnitude of this force depends upon the state of the substance and on the magnitude of the intermolecular spaces. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Motion</h5>
		<p>The molecules are always in a state of motion. In solids, they vibrate about their mean positions, and in liquids and gases, they move randomly. Due to their motion, molecules possess kinetic energy. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Temperature</h5>
		<p>On heating, the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, and they move faster. Based on the kinetic molecular theory, description of the arrangement and movement of the particles in the three states of matter can be summarised in table below.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Interconversion between states of matter</h3>
	<p> Matter can change its state. Change in states of matter are reversible. This change can be brought about by:  </p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>pressure </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>temperature </p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>By applying a high pressure a gas can be changed into a liquid. By changing temperature a change in state can be brought about. Figure below shows the interconversion between the three states of matter caused by absorption or evolution of heat energy. </p>

<section class="skill" id="06">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Melting</h3>
	<p>Melting is the process whereby a solid changes into a liquid. Heat is absorbed during melting. Melting takes place at a fixed temperature called the melting point. Melting point is the fixed temperature at a certain pressure where by a solid changes into a liquid. A pure substance has a fixed melting point. Impurities lower the melting point of a substance. Increasing pressure lowers the melting point of ice but increases the melting point of other substances. </p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="07">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Boiling</h3>
	<p>Boiling is the process whereby a liquid changes into a gas. This change in state occurs inside the liquid. Heat is absorbed during boiling. Boiling takes place at a fixed temperature called the boiling point. The boiling point is the fixed temperature at a certain pressure whereby a liquid changes into a gas. A pure liquid has a fixed boiling point. Impurities elevate the boiling point of a substance. Increasing pressure increases the boiling point of a substance.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="08">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Evaporation</h3>
	<p> Evaporation is the process whereby a liquid changes into a gas. This change in state takes place at the surface of the liquid. Heat is absorbed during evaporation. Evaporation takes place at all temperatures below the boiling point of the liquid, i.e., when the substance is still in the liquid state</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Condensation</h3>
	<p>Condensation is the process whereby a gas changes into a liquid. This change in state takes place when a gas is cooled to its boiling point. Heat is evolved during condensation.Condensation takes place at a fixed temperature numerically equal to its boiling point.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="10">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Freezing</h3>
	<p>Freezing is the process whereby a liquid changes into a solid. Heat is evolved during freezing. Freezing takes place at a fixed temperature called the freezing point. The freezing point is the fixed temperature whereby a liquid changes into a solid. Freezing and melting points have the same numerical value. A pure substance has a fixed freezing point. Impurities lower the freezing point of a substance. Increasing pressure depresses the freezing point of water but increases the freezing points of other substances.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="11">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Sublimation</h3>
	<p>Sublimation is the process whereby interconversion between solid state and gaseous state occurs without passing through the liquid state. Heat is absorbed when a solid changes into a gas. Heat is evolved when a gas changes into a solid. Sublimation takes place at a fixed temperature. Iodine, dry ice, aluminium chloride and ammonium chloride undergo sublimation.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Solid <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \rightarrow  \) </span> Liquid (Melting)</h4>
		<p>On heating a solid, the particles absorb heat energy. Heat energy is converted into kinetic energy. Kinetic energy of particles increases and particles vibrate faster and faster. At the melting point, particles have gained enough energy to overcome the attractive forces between them. Particles are able to move away from their positions and form a liquid. At the melting point, temperature remains constant because heat energy is used to overcome attractive forces between particles and separate the particles so as to change the solid into a liquid. Energy required to change a solid into a liquid at its melting point is known as latent heat of fusion. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Liquid Gas (Boiling)</h4>
		<p>On further heating, the kinetic energy of the particles increases even further. The particles move about faster and faster. At the boiling point, particles have gained enough energy to overcome the attractive forces between particles and break free from one another. The particles are able to escape from the liquid and form a gas. At the boiling point, temperature remains constant because heat energy is used to overcome attractive forces between particles and separate the particles to change the liquid into a gas. Energy required to change a liquid into a gas at its boiling point is known as latent heat of vaporization. </p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Gas <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \rightarrow  \) </span> liquid (Condensation)</h4>
		<p>When a liquid is cooled, the particles lose heat energy. The kinetic energy of the particles decreases. The particles move about slowly. The attractive forces between particles are now able to draw the particles closer together. Condensation takes place and the gas changes into a liquid. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Liquid <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \rightarrow  \) </span> Solid(Freezing) </h4>
		<p>On further cooling, the kinetic energy of the particles decreases even further. The particles slow down even more. The attractive forces between particles are now able to stop the particles from moving freely. Freezing takes place and the liquid becomes a solid. </p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>The number of molecules in steam and water are not equal. <br />
						The molecules in steam are distributed very far apart from each other. <br />
						The molecules in water are arranged very close together. Hence there are less molecules in steam than in water.</p>
