	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Water is a colourless, odourless and tasteless liquid that covers over 70 % of the Earth's surface. It is present in rain, clouds and the seas. Water is not only all around us, but it is inside us as well. On an average, the human body contains almost 65 % water. Some foods are almost all water. For example, a ripe tomato consists of nearly 95 % water.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="02">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Historical Note</h3>
	<p>In 1669, Becher and Stahl put forward the theory of phlogiston, an imaginary constitute of combustible bodies, which escapes from them when they burn. Phlogiston was represented by the Greek letter <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   \phi  \) </span>
		<br />
		In 1781, Henry Cavendish showed that water could be prepared by introducing an electric spark through a mixture of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="03">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Occurance of water</h3>
	<p>It is found in the combined states in certain minerals and crystalline substances. Water is the only substance that can exist in all three states (solid, liquid, gas), at ordinary temperature and pressure.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">In solid state</h4>
		<p>It occurs as ice, snow and hail stones in Polar regions and mountainous areas of the Earth. As the temperature rises during summer, some amount of these forms melt down.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">In liquid state</h4>
		<p>Water in the liquid state covers about three-fourth of the surface of the Earth. The volume of water in ocean is estimated to be <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3 \times 10^{18}  \) </span> cubic metres.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">In gaseous  state</h4>
		<p>A large amount of water is present in the form of vapours in the atmosphere. This water plays a vital role in sustaining life in plants and animals. A dry weather (without moisture) is injurious to plant and animal tissues.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">In the form of water of crystallization</h4>
		<p>The characteristic shape and colour of the crystals are due to water of crystallization. Water is a constituent of certain crystalline substances. Such water is called water of crystallization. <br />
			Water of crystallization is taken up by the substances during the crystallization process. The saturated solution of a substance on slow cooling throws out the substance in the form of crystals. It is during the cooling process that the crystal absorbs water as water of crystallization.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Hydrated salts and anhydrous salts</h4>
		<p>Compounds containing water of crystallization are called hydrated salts. If the water of crystallization is removed, then the compound is said to be anhydrous. Hydrated salts on strong heating lose water of crystallization and give rise to anhydrous salts. For example,  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Na_2CO_3.2H_2O  \) </span> is hydrated sodium carbonate. On heating, it changes to  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Na_2CO_3  \) </span> (anhydrous sodium carbonate). <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Note:</span>
			<br />
			All crystalline compounds do not contain water of crystallization, e.g. sodium chloride (NaC1), potassium nitrate <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (KNO_3)  \) </span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Surface water</h4>
		<p>Surface water is present on the surface of the Earth. It is of three types:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Rain water</p>

				<li>
					<p>Sea water</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">River and lake water</h5>
		<p>The water in rivers and lakes comes from rain and melting of snow on the mountains. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Sea water</h5>
		<p>Rivers finally flow into the sea and therefore, seas are the largest reservoirs of natural water. <br />
			The water which contains large amounts of dissolved salts is called saline water. 97.4% of the total water available on the Earth is in oceans. It is salty and hence is unfit for consumption or agriculture.</p>

	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Water is a colourless, odourless and tasteless liquid. Deep water bodies like ponds, lakes, rivers and appear greenish blue due to the scattering of light.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Ice melts and water freezes at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0^{\circ} C  \) </span> at 1 atm. The melting point decreases with increase in pressure, and rises with decrease in pressure.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Water boils at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  100^{\circ} C  \) </span> at 1 atm. The boiling point of water is reduced at higher altitudes as the atmospheric pressure decreases. <br />
					In a pressure cooker, food is cooked better and quicker because the temperature of the boiling water inside the cooker, i.e., under pressure, is higher than <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  100^{\circ} C  \) </span>, say<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  110^{\circ} C  \) </span> or so. Surgical instruments are sterilized in an autoclave, which works on the same principle as a pressure cooker. At temperatures higher than <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  100^{\circ} C  \) </span>, the bacteria are killed. As is the case with other liquids, the boiling point of water rises as the pressure is raised and decreases as the pressure is lowered.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Pure water freezes at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0^{\circ} C  \) </span> at 760 mm of mercury pressure. Presence of impurities lowers the freezing point, i.e., the water freezes at temperature lower than <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0^{\circ} C  \) </span>. At higher pressure, the freezing point is slightly less than <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0^{\circ} C  \) </span>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Pure water is a bad conductor of heat and electricity.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Anamolous expansion of water: This is the unique physical property of water. On cooling, the volume of water gets contracted first, just as other liquids. But at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  4^{\circ} C  \) </span>, it expands till the temperature reaches <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0^{\circ} C  \) </span>, where it freezes at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0^{\circ} C  \) </span>.</p>

	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Dissolved gases in water</h4>
		<p>Large water surfaces are in direct contact with atmospheric air. Since, the forces of attraction between gas molecules are small, the gases present in air dissolve to some extent in the water. <br />
			Air is a mixture. Hence, the solubility of air in water is actually the solubility of each of the constituents of air i.e., oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Oxygen being more soluble in water than nitrogen, air dissolved in water contains a higher percentage of oxygen (30-35%) than ordinary air (21%). <br />
			The solubility of gases in water decreases with the increase in temperature. Hence, dissolved gases can be removed by boiling.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">	Types of water</h3>
	<p>There are two types of water: Hard water and soft water. <br />
		Water that lathers with soap easily is called soft water. <br />
		Water that does not lather with soap easily is called hard water. <br />
		The presence of soluble salts (like bicarbonates, sulphates or chlorides) of calcium and magnesium in a sample of water makes it hard. <br />
		Soap contains sodium salts of fatty acids. (Fatty acids are organic acids containing a large number of carbon atoms.) These salts produce lather with water. However, the calcium and magnesium salts of these fatty acids are insoluble. So, when a soap is treated with hard water, the calcium and magnesium salts of the fatty acids precipitate in the form of a scum. As a result, the soap is consumed but no lather is produced. <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{\text{Sodium salt of thefatty acid}}{2Na(Ft)} + \underset{\text{Calcium bicarbonate}}{Ca(HCO_3)_2} \rightarrow \underset{\text{Sodium  bicarbonate}}{2NaHCO_3} + \underset{\text{Calcium salt of the fatty acid}}{Ca(Ft)_2}  \) </span>
		<br />
		Precipitation over clothes leaves dirty stains and that over your body causes irritation of the skin. <br />
		It is obvious that hardness of water increases with the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium salts. But remember that dissolved sodium or potassium salts (e.g., NaCl, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  K_2 , \ SO_4  \) </span>, etc.) do not make water hard. This is because the sodium and potassium salts of fatty acids do not precipitate. And water containing sodium and potassium salts does lather with soap.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Types of hard water</h4>
		<p>The hardness of some water samples can be removed by boiling, but not of all. On this basis, hard water is classified into two types. <br />
			When the hardness of a water sample can be removed by boiling, it is called <span class="highlight01"> temporarily hard water.</span>
			<br />
			When the hardness of a water sample cannot be removed by boiling, it is called <span class="highlight01"> permanently hard water </span>. <br />
			Temporary hardness is caused by the dissolved bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium. Permanent hardness is caused by the dissolved sulphates and chlorides of calcium and magnesium.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Softening of Water</h5>
		<p>If the hardness of water is removed, soft water is produced and the process is called softening of water. <br />
			The following methods are used to soften water. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Boiling</h5>
		<p>Temporarily hard water can be softened by boiling it. When such water is heated, the bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium are decomposed to the carbonates. Being insoluble, the carbonates precipitate out. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   \underset{\text{Calcium bicarbonate}}{Ca(HCO_3)_2} \rightarrow \underset{\text{Calcium carbonate}}{CaCO_3} \downarrow + CO_2 + H_2O  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Treating with washing soda</h5>
		<p>Permanent hardness of water is removed by treating with washing soda <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(    (Na_2CO_3 . 10H_2O)  \) </span>. A solution of washing soda is added to the water, and the carbonates of calcium and magnesium are precipitated. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   \underset{\text{Calcium sulphate}}{CaSO_4} + \underset{Sodium \ carbonate}{Na_2 CO_3} \rightarrow \underset{\text{Calcium carbonate}}{CaCO_3} \downarrow + \underset{Sodium \ chloride \ (in \ solution)}{2NaCl}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Sodium chloride formed will not make the water hard. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Clark's Method</h5>
		<p>Temporary hardness can also be removed when hard water is mixed with slaked lime in solid or liquid form. The bicarbonates present in the water are changed into carbonates. These are not soluble in water. So they form a residue at the bottom. By this method temporary hardness of water can be removed and soft water is obtained. <br />

			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Ca(HCO_3)_2 + Ca(OH)_2 \rightarrow 2 CaCO_3  2H_2O  \) </span>
