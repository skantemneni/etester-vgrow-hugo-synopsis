	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Carbon is a universally occurring element. It is found in free as well as combined state. In the free state, carbon occurs as graphite, diamond and coal. Compounds of carbon on the other hand make up the structure of all living things. Carbon forms a large number of compounds with other elements. <br />
		The carbon compounds are studied under a separate section called organic chemistry. However, some carbon compounds like carbonates, bicarbonates, carbides, cyanides and oxides are studied under inorganic chemistry <br />

		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C \Rightarrow 1s^2 \ 2s^2 \ 2p^2  \) </span>
		<br /> 
		After oxygen and hydrogen, it is the third most important element. It occurs both in free state and in the combined states. <br />
		In the free state it occurs as diamond, graphite and coal. <br />
		In the combined state, it occurs in all solid, liquid and gaseous state.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Unique Characteristic of Carbon</h3>
	<p> Element carbon exhibits allotropy, shows catenation and the number of its compounds is very large. Hence a separate branch of chemistry namely organic chemistry is studied. It also has isotope <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C^{14}  \) </span>, which is used in carbon dating to know the age of plants and vegetable origin.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Allotropy</h4>
		<p>The existence of an element in two or more physical forms, is called allotropy. And the forms are called allotropes. <br />
			Allotropy is mainly due to the different atomic arrangement. <br />
			arbon has both crystalline and amorphous forms of allotropes.</p>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Process</h5>
		<p>Pure carbon obtained from cane sugar or graphite is added to molten iron in an electric furnace at a temperature above  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3000^{\circ} C  \) </span>
			<br />
			By cooling this suddenly to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  300^{\circ} C  \) </span>, solidification of iron takes place. Due to very high pressure on the dissolved carbon, it crystallizes out in the form of diamond.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Structure</h4>
		<p>The four valence electrons in the carbon atom are bonded strongly with the other four neighboring carbon atoms. These carbon atoms are again further bonded to four other carbons and so on in a regular tetrahedron pattern. <br />
			It forms a giant three dimensional structure of tetrahedron giving crystalline form.</p>
