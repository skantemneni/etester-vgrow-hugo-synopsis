	<h3 class="skill-heading">Biodiversity</h3>
	<p>The earth is full of life. No one knows exactly the varieties of living organisms existing on the earth, etc are innumerable nnum erable microbes, plants and animals. It is estimated that nearly 10 to 15 million Series (types) of organisms are there on the earth of which nearly 2 million have been discovered, identified and. listed. Many ofthe organisms are still not known to man. In addition, new varieties organisms are evolving and many of the old forms are disappearing from time to time. The total number of life forms (varieties. of living organisms) on the earth are referred to as <span class="highlight01"> biodiversity </span> (bio meaning life; diversity meaning variety).</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Species</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> Species </span> Species is a group of individuals (organisms) having structural and functional similarity. Species breed freely among themselves to give rise to progeny (children) similar to parents.<br />
			We make use of terms like conservation, preservation and protection for some purpose but each term has a different connotation (meaning or implication). <br />
			Human beings are scientifically named as <span class="highlight01"> Homo sapiens </span> belonging to one species 'sapiens'. All  Homo sapiens  interbreed freely. </p>

		<p> All cats are <span class="highlight01"> Felis (genus) </span> with thick fur, pointed teeth and sharp claws but they cannot interbreed. Domestic cat cannot interbreed with tiger, leopard or lion; tiger cannot interbreed with domestic cat, leopard or lion. Felis includes different <span class="highlight01"> species </span>: F.domesticus, F.tigris, F.leopardus, F.leo . All domestic cats can breed among cats only, all tigers can breed among tigers and so on.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> The group of individuals which are able to breed freely among themselves form a species. </span>
			<br />
			Similarly, in plants though all Ficus plants bear similar fruit but pollens from bengalensis species can pollinate the flowers from same species only and not any other Ficus plants.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Flora and Fauna</h4>
		<p> The term flora is used to include all types of plants at a place. Though this term has come from flora meaning flower but it includes even the non-flowering plants such as ferns, mosses, algae, fungi and bacteria. Similarly, the term fauna is used to include all types of animals. Plant population ofa place or the variety of species ofplants living in their natural half (surroundings) are termed as the flora of the place. Similarly, animal population ofa place variety of the animal living in their natural habitat (surroundings) are termed as the fauna place. For example, listing and describing plants found on Simla hills is named as Flora Simlensis. All kinds of life at a place together form the biodiversity of the place.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">The unknown world of living organisms</h3>
	<p> Man has been able to identify and enlist nearly 2 million species of organisms out ofnearly 10 million estimated to be existing upon the earth. You can well imagine how ignorant we are about variety of life. Many of the organisms have not even been viewed because of their remote location. The unknown organisms are mostly existing on inaccessible high hills, deep sea and land forms. Exact variety of life on earth is many times more that what we may imagine.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="03">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Importance of biological diversity</h3>
	<p>Each organism on this earth has its own importance. These organisms while living on the earth are interacting with one another. The interaction between them is mainly for their survival. We have also learnt that one organism is the food for another. Thus each organism is essential for the growth and survival of another. We have also learnt about the <span class="highlight01"> FOOD CHAIN </span>. Food chain is a linked system of organisms, and each organism is important for the next to maintain the continuity of life. <span class="highlight01">Ultimately, the entire bio-system is a life support system for human race.</span>

</section>
<section class="skill" id="04">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Role of forests</h3>
	<p> Forests are the <span class="highlight01"> good abode for WILDLIFE </span>. Wildlife includes all forms of life, both plants and animals. Wild plants maybe microbes, algae, fungi, liverworts (bryophytes), ferns, conifers and flowering plants, from minute forms (1 mm in size) to lofty trees (going up to the height of more than 50 m). The animals may be microbes, worms, insects, frogs, fish, birds and mammals (herbivores and carnivores). Plants and animals are interdependent. Forest is the place where both, plants and animals add to the biodiversity. <span class="highlight01"> Inaccessible places </span> are the places which are difficult to reach. Such places may be high hills, deep seas or ravines covered with dense forests and wildlife. The life at such places is not disturbed by man. Natural evolution or extinction of life forms goes on at such places. This helps in the natural conservation of biodiversity.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="05">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Loss of biodiversity</h3>
	<p> In nature, new forms of organisms are evolving and at the same time many of the old forms are disappearing. This biological <span class="highlight01"> evolution </span> (coming ofnew forms) and biological <span class="highlight01"> extinction </span> (degeneration of some of the old forms) is a natural phenomenon. It is a very slow process even then it makes a vast difference in life forms over a long period of time. Adding of new forms of living organisms add to the biodiversity. At the same time loss of certain old forms is the <span class="highlight01"> degeneration of biodiversity </span>
		<br />
		Real danger to the biodiversity comes from :-</p>

				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Storms and cyclones </span> are the atmospheric disasters caused by strong winds. Depending up on the speed of the wind and its shape these are termed as hurricanes, typhoons and tornadoes. Strong winds destroy many plants and animals.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Earthquakes </span> is the displacement ofthe rocks below the earth's crust which causes the grout to shake or vibrate. Powerful earthquakes may result in cracks appearing on the earn which the plant and animal life in the region may get buried. This results in destroying many of the species of organisms. Earthquakes along seacoast may also cause huge sea waves called Tsunamis. Tsunamis destroy life forms along the sea coasts.</p>
				</li>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Man-made Disaters</h4>
		<p> Man made disasters have been a major factor in the degeneration ofbiodiversity. Someof the human activities listed below have changed the face of the 'LIFE FORMS' upon the earth :- </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Population and Urbanisation </span>
						<br />
						Growth in human population and urbanisation has tremendously affected the wild life on the earth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Deforestation</span>
						<br />
						Deforestation has been the first act ofman to have destroyed many life forms. We have learnt that many organisms are supported by forests. Forests being cut and destroyed are causing the disappearance of many plant and animal species from the face of the earth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Changes in land use patterns</span>
						<br />
						Changes in land use patterns for cultivation ofcrop plants, raising oforchards, building of the houses, laying ofroads and canals, raising ofdams and creating artificial lakes and all such human activities have caused loss of biodiversity.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Energy consumption and Emissions</span>
						<br />
						Energy consumption and Emissions have been resulting in the loss of fuel plants, which might have been fodder for the life forms. The life forms disappeared for want of food. Then, the poisonous gases being emitted by burning fuel cause pollution, adversely affecting biodiversity, both directly and indirectly.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Pollution</span>
						<br />
						Pollution due to excessive use ofchemicals, fertilizers, pesticides and weedicides have not only harmed the life on earth but it has also caused the pollution of groundwater resources which are harmful even for man himself. This results in poisoning of biodiversity. Many animals forms die from eating poisoned seeds and fruits and taking polluted water.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Exotic species</span>
						<br />
						Replacing age old varieties ofcrop and wild plants with new breeds and genetically modified (Gm) varieties are resulting in the loss of certain indigenous varieties. This is true for crop plants and food yielding animals.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Natural resources exploitation</span>
						<br />
						Excessive exploitation ofnatural resources also result in degeneration ofcertain species. For example, many medicinal plants and fleshy animals have disappeared in the past.<span class="highlight01"> Dodo </span>, a flightless bird from Mauritius was easily captured and killed ruthlessly for food resulting in its total disappearance from the island. It is extinct today.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Other factors</span>
						<br />
						Competition for food and survival comes in the way of preserving wild life. Mechanisation on farms is also affecting the population of cattle like horses, mules, donkeys, ox and bulls, which were kept by farmers as draught animals. These cattle are getting rare.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Effects of deforestation</h3>
	<p>Continuous cutting of trees has a disastrous effect on surroundings.
		Destroying of forests result in slerious consequences. Some ofthe effects of deforestation are:</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Desertification : </span> On cutting of a tree soil is left exposed to weather conditions which results in ge ofphysical property ofthe soil. Top soil loses water, becomes dry and lose. Over a long period time it gets sandy as the soil in desert. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Soil erosion : </span> Loose soil is easily eroded by wind and water.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> Harm to groundwater: </span> Due to lack of percolation of rainwater, the water table ofthe ground water gets low. This is a big loss to the water conservation and augmentation of groundwater.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> Change in climate: </span> Deforestation results in strong winds, rise in temperature of surroundings and reduced rain. All these changes lead to change in climate of the place.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> Global warming: </span> Reduced greenery means reduced consumption of carbon dioxide. Deforestation results in increasing the level of carbon dioxide in atmosphere causing global warming.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> Destruction of habitats: </span> Many plants and animals which survive on resources and homes forest lose their habitats. This results in the loss of wildlife.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> Decrease in rainfall and affecting water cycle: </span> It is a natural phenomenon that clouds are
					attracted to areas which are humid. Forest trees transpire great amount of water making atmosphere humid. Thus forests help rain and maintain water cycle. This also augments groundwater. If the forests are cut the soil gets dry.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Forest Resetves</h4>
		<p> Forest reserve is a specified land area which is demarcated into different zones with specific! activities in each zone. The purpose is to preserve both, forests and wildlife.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Protected Zone: </span> Human activity in this zone is totally prohibited. The land is covered with well grown trees and undisturbed habitats for wildlife. No cutting of trees. Even collection of deal firewood is prohibited.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Buffer Zone: </span> This zone is on the way to develop into a dense forest. Replenishment of lost
						forest cover by planting saplings for trees has been done in this zone. Simultaneously, habitats are developed for wildlife.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Nursery Zone: </span> In this zone nursery for forest trees is maintained. Provision is being made for
						the protection of shelter and managing source of food for wildlife. This is actually a zone where activities for the development and betterment of forests and wildlife are being undertaken. </p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p> Many such forest reserves are being maintained in India. Our National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries serve this purpose. Large scale afforestation (replanting trees) in forests and also on bare land has been taken up to restore the forest wealth of the country.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Endangered species </h3>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01"> Endangered species </span> of plants and animals are those which are exposed to danger of extinction (loss forever). Many algae, fungi, bryophytes, ferns and gymnosperms, are disappearing with the destruction of forests. And, each disappearing species may take away with it many species of animals and microbes which depend on them for food and shelter. Similarly list of animals on the verge ofbeing lost is endless. Some ofthem are:<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Small creatures: </span> prawns, oyesters, lobsters, crabs, squids, octopus, cuttlefish, beatles, dragonfly, grasshoppers, fish and even frogs are dying of absorbing poisonous gases through their skin. Locust is one insect which has almost disappeared from India. Gloworms and fireflies are almost totally absent from Northern region of India.<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Similarly, following animals are getting rare :- </span>
		<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Reptiles: </span> Some lizards, turtles crocodiles and gharials.<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Frog: </span> Frog breathes through its moist skin and so it finds it difficult to breathe on land with
		poisonous gases in the air and in polluted water. Cemented water bodies have made it difficult for the frog to lay eggs and breed for survival.<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Birds: </span> Falcon, Eagle, hawk, vulture, peacock-peahen, pigeon, duck.<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Mammals </span> Wild cats such as tigers, lions, deers such as chinkara and blackbuck, chiru (Tibetan goat), musk deer, rhino, elephants, blue whale, flying squirrel.<br />
		In addition the endemic species are in geat danger of extinction. <span class="highlight01"> Endemic species of plants and animals are those which are limited to particular zones (areas) or islands </span>. Kiwis and kangaroos are endemic to Newzealand and Australia and the neighbouring islands. As and when an island is lost, the endemic species on it are also lost.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Noteworthy point</h4>
		<p> At one time Dinosaur ferns and some gymnosperms were wide-spread organisms on the earth. They disappeared from the earth, maybe due to shortage of space and food or due to climatic changes, but they are extinct today.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Farming Practices</h5>
		<p>Tiger has been the most endangered species, especially in India since forests are being cut and destroyed. Then, most tigers are being wiped out by poachers (hunters) killing them for their skin, bones, nails and teeth which are being sold within India and also exported to outside world.<br />
			At one time there were more than 40,000 tigers in India and hardly 1827 were counted ii The sharp decline in the population of Tigers was because of deforestation, increase in population, poaching and broken 'FOOD CHAIN'.<br />
			Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF) initiated a 'Project Tiger', funded by World <span class="highlight01"> WIB </span> (WWF) for nature for not only saving tiger population from exploitation by man but for its multiplication in its "Natural Habitat". For this nearly 18 tiger reserves have been created in India, where efforts are made to provide a natural habitat to tigers and encourage their breeding.<br />

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Conversation of Biodiversity</h3>
	<p> Biodiversity is important for all living creatures, including man for the preservation of environment and for economic reasons. Biodiversity is useful in scientific and medical research. The World Summit held a Convention on Biodiversity <span class="highlight01">(CBD) </span> for the conservation of biodiversity. As a result of this an International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources <span class="highlight01"> (IUCN) </span> has been established to look after the conservation projects. IUCN has now been renamed as World Conservation Union <span class="highlight01"> (WCU) </span>.<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> WWF (World Wide Fund for nature) </span> ) is an international organisation spreading awareness among people to help conserve wild life.<br />
