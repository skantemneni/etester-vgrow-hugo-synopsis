	<h3 class="skill-heading">Early Man's Food</h3>
	<p>Early man was primarily a hunter and a flesh-eater. He also ate fruits and seeds. He did not cultivate food. He was a food gatherer. He and his family had to go without food when the weather was rough This made him change his habit to domesticating cattle and growing of plants along his dwelling unitsThis enabled him to make use of food available around his home in case he could not go for hunting. Since man, animals and plants require water all round the year, people started settling near rivers, lakes and ponds. This was the beginning of food production by man</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Agriculture and Farming</h3>
	<p>When man adopted to plant eating along with flesh eating, he started <span class="highlight01">collecting seeds</span>. The seeds were scattered, germinated and grew. The produce of the plants was used as <span class="highlight01">food</span> and the <span class="highlight01">plant body </span> was left as fodder for cattle. With the increase in demand for food, man became aware of taking care of plants. This was the beginning of <span class="highlight01">agriculture</span>. The word agriculture has come from two latin words, ager meaning field and culture meaning cultivation. Agriculture or farming is the cultivation of soil. It includes growing of plant <span class="highlight01">crops and rearing of animals.</span>

<section class="skill" id="07">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Improving Soil Fertility</h3>
	<p>Top soil supports plant life. Herbs (crops) grow in top soil and derive their mineral nutrition from it. Once a crop is harvested, the top soil in which the top soil has been growing gets poor in minerals.This soil needs enrichment with minerals before another crop is planted on it.<br />
		First thing a farmer does is to plough the fields. Ploughing turns the soil and brings the leached minerals up from the soil below. Ploughing may not help much in improving the soil fertility. The lost plant nutrients in the soil are replenished with the addition of fertilizers.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Fertilizers</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Fertilizers </span> are the substances which contain nutrients essential for plant growth. The types of fertilizers are: </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Natural fertilizers or organic fertilizers </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Chemical fertilizers or inorganic fertilizers</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Natural Fertilizers</h5>
		<p>Natural fertilizers include naturally occurring organic materials or naturally occurring mineral deposits. Manure or compost is the decomposed plant and animal waste (farm waste including animal droppings), waste food, dead and dry leave and offal (includes garbage and dried left over flesh from slaughtering animals) goes into the making of the compost</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Manure-Its Preparation</h5>
		<div class="list1-ul default-spaced-indented list-bullet-style-image-square">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Compost is prepared by the farmers on their farms</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>A deep pit is made in a corner of the field which is filled with farm waste, straw and dead leave from time to time</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>This is covered with a layer of soil and is moistened by sprinkling water over it from time to time</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Worms, insects and microbes grow on it and help in decay the organic matter, turning it into humus </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Humus is rich in minerals, microbes and decayed organic matter</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Green Manure</h5>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Green manure</span> is a type of cover crop grown primarily to add nutrients and organic matter to the soil.'There is a time gap between harvesting a crop and sowing of the next crop. Instead of leaving the field without any plants on it during the gap period, a fast growing leafy leguminous fodder crop such as <span class="highlight01">Trifolium (Barseem) </span>, or <span class="highlight01">Alfalfa </span> or <span class="highlight01">Sasbania</span> is sown This crop come up soon and it yields green leafy fodder for the cattle. The roots of these plants bear <span class="highlight01">root nodules </span> with <span class="highlight01">nitrogen fixing bacteria </span>. This <span class="highlight01">enriches soil</span> with mineral nutrients.<br />
			While preparing the field for sowing the next crop, the field is ploughed along with <span class="highlight01">green leguminous crop</span> and it's nodule bearing roots. The green plants along with the roots go into the soil and decompose to form organic manure (compost).</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Nitrogen Fixation</h5>
		<p>It is the natural way of fixing nitrogen in the soil. Body of living organisms is made of proteins. Proteins are compounds of <span class="highlight01"> nitrogen, carbon, oxygen </span> and <span class="highlight01"> hydrogen </span>. <span class="highlight01"> 78% of air is nitrogen </span>. Air nitrogen is fixed into compounds of nitrogen (nitrogen oxides soluble in water) by certain microorganisms. Microorganisms such as <span class="highlight01"> Rhizobium (Bacillus)</span> are present in the <span class="highlight01"> root nodules</span> of leguminous plants. Bacterium <span class="highlight01">Rhizobium radicicola </span> is capable of fixing air nitrogen.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104570002_image-10.png" alt="image10" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p> Fixation of nitrogen enriches the soil in a natural way. Fertilizers need not be added to the soil in which crops bearing root nodules with nitrogen fixing bacteria in them have been grown.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Root nodules </span> occur on the roots of plants that associate with <span class="highlight01"> symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria </span>. Nitrogen fixed by the bacterium is supplied as additional nitrogenous nutrition to the host plant. In turn, the host provides shelter and carbohydrate food to the bacterium. This process, in which the bacterium and the plant live together for mutual benefit, is called <span class="highlight01">symbiosis </span>.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Rotation of Crops </span>
			<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Growing of a leguminous crop in between two cereal or vegetable crops is called rotation of crops </span>.In multiple or mixed cropping, two or more crops are sown simultaneously in the same field.One of these is a leguminous crop.These crops grow and mature at the same time.<br />
			For example, corn (maize) and soyabean (legume) or any other pulse are cultivated together as Kharif or summer crop.</p>

		 </div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Chemical Fertilizers</h5>
		<p>Any nutrient added to the soil for improving its fertility is called a <span class="highlight01"> Fertilizer </span>. <span class="highlight01"> Fertilizer </span> maybe natural (compost made from farm waste or the green manure) or synthetic (prepared from chemicals in Fertilizer factories),In common use, <span class="highlight01"> manure or compost </span> is a natural fertilizer and chemical compounds are synthetic fertilizers or simply fertilizers.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Composition </span>
			<br />
			Fertilizers are chemical compounds of mineral nutrients for plants. They are prepared in Fertilizer factories. The essential parts of nutrients are, Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P) and Potassium (K)<br />
			Fertilizer may be a mix of three major plant nutrients such as Sulpha mix (NPK) or single nutrient such as Superphosphate (P), Potash (K), or Urea (N).<br />
			Some common fertilizers used by farmers, in addition to the above are Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and Calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN)<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Examples: </span>
			<br />
			Some common fertilizers are: Urea, Super phosphate, Potassium sulphate, Ammonium phosphate, Potassium phosphate, etc.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Note : </span>
		</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Fertilizers are highly <span class="highlight01"> hygroscopic (absorb water) </span> and <span class="highlight01"> leach </span> soon into the soil.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In addition, some <span class="highlight01"> micronutrients </span> like <span class="highlight01"> sulphur </span> and <span class="highlight01"> magnesium </span> compounds are also added to the soil.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Lime </span> is often added to the soil to nutralize its acidity</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Applications of Chemical Fertilizers</h5>
		<p>Time of application of different fertilizers is different for different crops and at different stages of growth, Some fertilizers are added to the soil at the time of sowing, some at the time of stem elongation and leaf growth, and some towards flowering and reproductive growth.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Points to be noted during their applications</h5>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Fertilizers should be used with utmost care .</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Too much use of fertilizers can upset the chemical nature of the soil and also result in the 'burning' (browning) of the leaves of the crop plants</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Fertilizers may also leach into the soil with rainwater to poison the groundwater. Otherwise fertilizer is the sure, fastest and easiest way of providing mineral nutrition to the crop plants.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Organic Farming</h5>
		<p>Worms, specially the earthworms, are a great friend of farmers. They flourish well in moist soil rich in decaying organic matter. Worms eat into the soil to burrow themselves, leaving behind the casts and canals, making the soil airy, soft and fertile <br />
			The Government of India has established National Institure of Organic Farming with its Head Quarters at Ghaziabad and six regional offices, each at Bengalooru, Hissar, Jabalpur, Nagpur, Bhubaneshwar and Imphal, and a centre at Ludhiana.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Irrigation</h3>
	<p> Water is essential for the growth of plants. Different crops need varying amount of water at different phases of their growth. Proper watering of a crop at the right time is called irrigation. At times, the rains are scarce and the crops fail due to draught or there are heavy rains and crops get damaged due to floods. To overcome the dependence on rain, various irrigation schemes for efficient use of water resources are drawn depending upon the source of water.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Irrigation Schemes</h4>
		<p> Canal irrigation, raising of dams, from rivers and streams, Groundwater irrigation from wells, tube wells, lakes and ponds. In almost all the states of India there are dams to store runaway water behind them and canalize them for irrigation. Also, the water falling from dams is used for the generation of hydroelectricity.<br />
			In certain cases, the fields are flooded with water from tubewells or canals. Too much of water goes waste in this type of flood irrigation. Flood irrigation is required only for paddy crop. Fields are irrigated from time to time to save the crops from draught.<br />
			Paddy (rice) is the only crop, the saplings of which are planted in flooded fields.Even paddy is watered sparingly towards the maturation of the crop. Vegetable crops are irrigated almost daily with surface irrigation, through drip irrigation or sprinnklers. Sprinkler irrigation is considered most effective for herbs. It saves on water.</p>

		Growing Vegetables, Growing fruits, Stroage of fruits and vegatables.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Growing Vegetables</h4>
		<p>The process of growing vegatables is different from cultivating cereal or pulse crops. Vegetables are mostly soft, seasonal and herbaceous plants. Their storage life (shelf life) is too short and they need immediate transportation to market for sale. Only tubers (potato), corms (ol or zamikand), rhizomes(ginger, turmeric) and bulbs (onion, garlic) can be stored that too not for long.<br />
			Growth of vegetables is better in compost rich soil, which is moist, airy and porous. Use fertilizers for vegatables must be limited. Vegetables crops are better irrigated through spray or drip method. Excessive watering may harm and destroy the vegetable crop. </p>

Since beehive stores honey, it is called honeycomb.Rearing bees for their honey is called <span class="highlight01"> apiculture </span>. Apis is the scientific name for honeybee.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> How are bees reared ? </span>
			<br />
			For rearing bees, special woodden boxes are placed in and around orchards. Bees move in and out through the pores in the door and develop hive inside the box. These boxes are called apiaries.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> What is Honey? </span>
			<br />
			Nectar collected by honeybees from flowers is sugar solution which gets concentrated on dehydration into glucose and fructose solution and gets mixed with enzymes, vitamins and minerals coming from bees <br />
			Quality of honey depends upon the kind of bees and the type of flowers from where nectar is collected. Good quality honey is medicinal and may also possess antibiotic properties<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Test for Purity of Honey </span>
			<br />
			Pure honey when poured in a glass of water goes down forming a thread of honey in the water.Impure honey made from sugar disperses in water without forming a thread. </p>
