	<h3 class="skill-heading">Discovery of the cell</h3>
	<p>Robert Hooke in 1665 observed slices ofcork under a simple magnifying device. Cork is a part of the bark ofa tree. He took thin slices of cork and observed them under a microscope. He noticed partitioned boxes or compartments in the cork slice.</p>

	 </div>
	<p> These boxes appeared like a honeycomb. He also noticed that one box was separated from the other by a wall or partition. Hooke coined the term 'cell' for each box. What Hooke observed as boxes or cells in the cork were actually dead cells.<br />
		Cells of living organisms could be observed only after the discovery of improved microscopes. Very little was known about the cell for the next 150 years after Robert Hooke's observations. Today, we know a lot about cell structure and its functions because of improved microscopes having high magnification.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">The cell</h3>
	<p> Both, bricks in a building and cells in the living organisms, are basic structural units. The buildings, though built of similar bricks, have different designs, shapes and sizes. Similarly, the living world, organisms differ from one another but all are made up of cells. Cells in the living organisms are complex living structures unlike non-living bricks.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Organisms show variety in cell number, shape and size</h3>
	<p> How do scientists observe and study the living cells? They use microscopes which magnify objects. Stains (dyes) are used to colour parts of the cell to study the detailed structurs. There are millions living organisms. They are of different shapes and sizes. Their organs also vary in shape, size and number of cells. Let us study some of them</p> 
	<section class="subskill"> 
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Number of Cells</h4>
		<p>Can you guess the number of cells in a tall tree or in a huge animal like the elephant? The number runs into billions and trillions. Human body has trillions ofcells which vary in shapes and sizes. Different groups of cells perform a variety of functions.<br />
			A billion is a thousand million. A trillion is a thousand billion. Organisms made of more than one cell are called <span class="highlight01"> multicellular </span> (mufti : many; cellular : cell) organisms. The number of cells being less in smaller organisms does not, in any way, affect the functioning of the organisms. You will be surprised to know that an organism with billions of cells begins life as a <span class="highlight01"> single cell </span> which is the fertilised egg. The fertilised egg cell multiplies and the number ofcells increase as development proceeds.<br />
			The single-celled organisms are called <span class="highlight01">unicellular </span> (uni : one; cellular : cell) organisms. A single-celled organism performs all the necessary functions that multicellular organisms perform.<br />
			A single-celled organism, like amoeba, captures and digests food, respires, excretes, grows and reproduces. Similar functions in multicellular organisms are carried out by groups of specialised cells forming different tissues. Tissues, in turn, form organs.</p>

		 </div> 
	</section>
	<section class="subskill"> 
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Shape of Cells</h4>
		<p>How do you define the shape of Amoeba in the figure? You may say that the shape appears irregular. Infact, Amoeba has no definite shape, unlike other organisms. It keeps on changing its shape. Observe the projections of varying lengths protruding out of its body. <br />
			These are called <span class="highlight01"> pseudopodia </span> (pseudo : false; podia : feet),. projections appear and disappear as Amoeba moves or feeds. The change in shape is due to formation of pseudopodia  which facilitates movement and help in capturing food.<br />
			A white blood cell (WBC) in human blood is another example of a single cell which can change its shape. But while WBC is a cell, amoeba is a full fledged organism capable of independent existence. What shape would you expect in organisms with millions of cells? The figure below shows different cells such as blood, muscle and nerve cells of human beings. The different shapes are related to their specific functions. Generally, cells are round, spherical or elongated. Some cells are long and pointed at both ends.</p>

		 </div>
		<p> They exhibit spindle shape. Cells sometimes are quite long. Some are branched like the nerve cell or a neuron. The nerve cell receives and transfers messages, thereby helping to control and coordinate the working of different parts ofthe body.<br />
			Can you guess, which part ofthe cell gives it shape? Components ofthe cell are enclosed in a membrane. This membrane provides shape to the cells of plants and animals. Cell wall is an additional covering over the cell membrane in plant cells. It gives shape and rigidity to these cells. Bacterial cell also has a cell wall.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill"> 
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Size of Cells</h4>
		<p> The size of cells in living organisms may be as small as a millionth of a metre (micrometre or micron) or may be as large as a few centimetres. However, most of the cells are microscopic in size and are not visible to the unaided eye. They need to be enlarged or magnified by a microscope. The smallest cell is 0.1 to 0.5 micrometre in bacteria.<br />
			The largest cell measuring 170 mm <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> 130 mm, isthe egg of an ostrich. The size of the cells has no relation with the size ofthe body of the animal or plant. It is not necessary that the cells in the elephant be much bigger than those in a rat. The size ofthe cell is related to its function. For example, nerve cells,
			both in the elephant and rat, are long and branched. They perform the same function, that oftransferring messages </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Cell Structure and Function</h3>
	<p> Each living organism has many organs. The digestive organs which together constitute the digestive system. Each organ in the system performs different functions such as digestion, assimilation and absorption. Similarly, different organs of a plant perform specific/specialised functions.<br />
		For example, roots help in the absorption of water and minerals. Leaves, are responsible for synthesis of foo(D) Each organ is further made up of smaller parts called <span class="highlight01"> tissues </span>. A tissue is a group of similar cells performing a specific function.<br />
		Paheli realised that an organ is made up of tissues which in turn, are made up of cells. The cell in a living organism is the basic structural unit.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Parts of the cell</h3> 
	<section class="subskill"> 
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Cell Membrane</h4>
		<p> The basic components of a cell are cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. The cytoplasm and nucleus are enclosed within the cell membrane,also called the plasma membrane. The membrane separates cells from one another and also the cell from the surrounding medium. The plasma membrane is porous and allows the movement of substances or materials both inward and outwar(D)<br />
			The boundary of the onion cell is the <span class="highlight01"> cell membrane </span> covered by another thick covering called the cell wall. The central dense round body in the centre is called the nucleus. The jelly-like substance between the <span class="highlight01"> nucleus </span> and the cell membrane is called <span class="highlight01">cytoplasm </span>.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104570005_image-5.png" alt="image5" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>The cell membrane gives shape to the cell. In addition to the cell membrane, there is an outer thick layer in cells ofplants called cell wall. This additional layer surrounding the cell membrane is required by the plants for protection. Plant cells need protection against variations in temperature, high wind speed, atmospheric moisture, et(C) They are exposed to these variations because they cannot move. Cells can be observed in the leaf peel of Tradescantia, Elodea or Rhoeo. You can prepare a slide as in the case of onion </p>

		 </div>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill"> 
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Cytoplasm</h4>
		<p> It is the jelly-like substance present between the cell membrane and the nucleus. Various other components, or <span class="highlight01"> organelles </span>, ofcells are present in the cytoplasm. These are mitochondria, golgi bodies, ribosomes, et(C) You will learn about them in later classes.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill"> 
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Nucelus</h4>
		<p> It is an important component ofthe living cell. It is generally spherical and located in the centre of the cell. It can be stained and seen easily with the help of a microscope. Nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane called the <span class="highlight01"> nuclear membrane </span>. This membrane is also porous and allows the movement ofmaterials between the cytoplasm and the inside ofthe nucleus.<br />
			With a microscope of higher magnification, we can see a smaller spherical body in the nucleus. It is called the <span class="highlight01"> nucleolus </span>. In addition, nucleus contains thread-like structures called <span class="highlight01"> chromosomes </span>. These carry <span class="highlight01"> genes </span> and help in inheritance or transfer of characters from the parents to the offspring. The chromosomes can be seenonly when the cell divides.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill"> 
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Gene</h4>
		<p> Gene is a unit of inheritance in living organisms. It controls the transfer of a hereditary characteristic from parents to offspring. This means that your parents pass some of their characteristics on to you. If your father has brown eyes, you may also have brown eyes. If your mother has curly hair, you might also end up having curly hair. However, the different combination of genes from parents result in different characteristics.<br />
			Nucleus, in addition to its role in inheritance, acts as control centre ofthe activities ofthe cell. The entire content ofa livinhg cell is known as protoplasm. It includes the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Protoplasm is called the living substance ofthe cell. The nucleus of the bacterial cell is not well organised like the cells of multicellular organisms. There is no nuclear membrane. The cells having nuclear material without nuclear membrane are termed <span class="highlight01"> prokaryotic cells </span>. The organisms with these kinds of cells are called <span class="highlight01"> prokaryotes </span> (pm : primitive; karyon : nucleus).<br />
			Examples are bacteria and blue green algae. The cells, like onion cells and cheek cells having well organised nucleus with a nuclear membrane are designated as <span class="highlight01"> eukaryotic cells </span>. All organisms other than bacteria and blue green algae are called <span class="highlight01"> eukaryotes </span>. (eu : true; karyon: nucleus).<br />
			While observing the onion cells under the microscope, did you notice any blank-looking structures in the cytoplasm? It is called <span class="highlight01"> vacuole </span>. It could be single and big as in an onion cell. Cheek cells have smaller vacuoles. Large vacuoles are common in plant cells. Vacuoles in animal cells are much smaller.<br />
			You might have noticed several small coloured bodies in the cytoplasm of the cells of Tradescantia leaf They are scattered in the cytoplasm of the leaf cells. These are called <span class="highlight01"> plastids </span>. They are of different colours. Some of them contain green pigment called chlorophyll. Green coloured plastids are called <span class="highlight01"> chloroplasts </span>. They provide green colour to the leaves. You may recall that chlorophyll in the chloroplasts ofleaves, is essential for photosynthesis.</p>
