	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>All living organisms have an instinct to live their own lives and then survive through their generations. Living things take birth, grow old and die. Before death individuals give birth to the off springs (children) to continue their race. Have you ever provoked you mind to know the <span class="highlight01">process </span> that leads to off springs? <br />
		The answer is right here .. . <br />
		This survival instinct is helped by the process of Reproduction. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Giving birth to off springs, which are similar to parents, is known as reproduction. </span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01"> Importance of Reproduction </span>
		<br />
		Reproduction is one of the most important characteristics of life. Reproduction is the creation of new life of its own kind. Reproduction is essential for the continuation of species. A species will disappear from the face of the earth if it does not reproduce. Reproduction takes place in both, plants and animals </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Asexual Reproduction</h3>
	<p>
		<i> In asexual reproduction, a single parent gives rise to new individuals </i>. Binary fission in Amoeba and Budding in Hydra are Asexual reproductions. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Binary Fission </h4>
		<p>
			<i> The asexual reproduction in which nucleus of the parent splits into two and gives rise to two new individuals, is called Binary Fission. </i>

			Eg: Amoeba, paramoecium, Euglena </p>

				<li>
					<p>	Amoeba, the unicellular organisms, multiplies by binary fission. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Sexual Reproduction</h3>
	<p> Look around and see for the young ones from different animals. Kitten, puppy, chick and calf some of the common young ones from different animals. Have you ever wondered as to how babies are born? The babies are the result of Sexual Reproduction. <br />
		<i> A mode of reproduction involving the fusion of female gamete and male gamete, which forms a zygote that potentially develops into genetically distinct offspring is called Sexual Reproduction </i>

			All egg laying animals are called oviparous animals. Insects, worms, frog, etc. are oviparous animals. We have already learnt about the lifecycle in some of the animals. <i> Let's study the life cycle of few of the oviparous animals </i>. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading"> Life Cycle of Butterfly </h3>
	<p> In butterfly male and female are separate. The female lays the eggs. The eggs laid are actually zygotes. The eggs are fertilized within the body of the mother (female) with the sperms from father (male). Fertilization in butterfly (insects) is internal. <br />

	<h3 class="skill-heading"> Reproduction in Toads and Frogs </h3>
	<p> Toads and frogs are common near a pond during early rains. Late in the rainy season or in the beginning of winter the male frog which is smaller and dark seeks the company of a big female frog. The female is fat with her belly full of eggs. <br />
		Both, male and female frogs swim around the pond for some time and then they come near the shore where the <span class="highlight01"> female starts laying eggs </span>. The big mass of eggs emerge from the body of the female, <span class="highlight01"> the male sheds sperms over them </span>. Sperms swim to the eggs. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Fusion of a sperm with an egg is called fertilization </span>
		<br />
		During fertilization, One sperm fuses with one egg (ovum) to form Zygote. </p>

				<p>Fertilization in frog takes place in water. </p>

			<li>
				<p>The tadpole stage in frog is an intermediate stage between aquatic and land habitat. </p>

			<li>
				<p>Adult frog has lungs for breathing in air. </p>

				<p>In addition to lungs frogs also breathe through their moist skin. <br />
					<i> The changes taking place through stages during the development of an animal from an egg to an
						adult is called metamorphosis. </i>

	<p> Hen and cock represent the birds. Chick or chickens come from hen. Hen is an oviparous animal. <br />
		It lays eggs. The eggs are fertilized internally before laying. <br />

			<li>
				<p>In the process of cloning, egg or ovum from a <span class="highlight01">black faced female </span> sheep 'A' was taken out of

				<p>Its nucleus was replaced with a nucleus from a 'baby cell' taken from the mammary gland of another <span class="highlight01"> white faced female </span> sheep 'B'. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> This cell with changed nucleus is implanted onto the womb of sheep 'A', where it developed into a normal baby sheep. </p>

			<li>
				<p>The baby thus born was found to be <span class="highlight01"> exactly similar </span> to the sheep 'B' and it is termed a 'clone'. </p>
