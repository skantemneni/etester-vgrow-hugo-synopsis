	<h3 class="skill-heading">How babies are formed ? </h3>
	<p>Among human beings we find mother and father, the parents. The mother in human beings give birth to babies that resemble their parents. Babies then grow into young adults. Method of reproduction is sexual reproduction. Basic process of sexual reproduction
		in human beings is the same as in all other animals. Both males and females bear special reproductivee cells, the <span class="highlight01"> gametes </span>. The male gamete is the <span class="highlight01"> sperm </span> and the female gamete is the <span class="highlight01"> ovum </span> (the egg cell). The two gametes unite during <span class="highlight01"> fertilization </span> forming <span class="highlight01"> zygote </span>. Fertilization in human beings is internal since it takes place inside the body of the female(mother). Zygote develops into an embryo and embryo into a baby. Baby maybe a girl or a boy. Mother gives birth to a baby.

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Fertilization and Embryo Development</h3>
	<p> The ovum from the ovary moves into the oviduct (falopian tube). Millions of sperms are transferred into the female and the sperms swim into the uterus reaching the oviduct. If an egg from the ovary has also reached the oviduct, ONLY one of the sperms may fuse (unite) with it forming a <span class="highlight01"> zygote </span> (oospore). The uniting sperm loses its tail outside and only its head enters the egg. Rest of the sperms degenerate. Fusion of male gamete (sperm) and the female gamete (egg) is called <span class="highlight01"> fertilization </span>. Fertilization takes place while the egg is passing through the fallopian tube or the oviduct. Zygote then moves into the uterus and gets attached to the endometrium (spongy cushion) on its wall. <br />
		In human beings and in animals such as cats, dogs, cows and birds fertilization takes place in-side the body of the female. Fertilization taking place inside the body of the female is called internal fertilization.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Development of embryo </h4>
		<p> Embryo is the baby in the early stages of formation. In the case of man embryo remains within the body of the mother. It is only the baby (fully developed embryo) which takes birth on the completion of gestation period. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> How babies develop inside the mother ? </h4>
		<p> Zygote formed as a result of fertilization divides and redivides into a ball of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and into numerous cells. The cells inside the ball starts getting differentiated into organs of a baby forming young <span class="highlight01">embryo </span>. By this time, the embryo gets attached to the wall of the uterus from where it starts drawing nutrition in the form of blood from the mother through a cord (called the <span class="highlight01"> umbilical cord </span>). The point of attachment of the cord to the wall of the uterus is called <span class="highlight01"> placenta </span>. By the time embryo is five weeks old it will have <span class="highlight01"> rudimentary eyes </span> and a <span class="highlight01"> beating heart </span>. By the time it is twelve weeks old it is a <span class="highlight01"> miniature baby </span>. It takes about 270 to 280 days for embryo to grow into a 'baby'. This period of growth of the embryo to a baby inside the mother's womb is called <span class="highlight01"> "pregnancy" </span>, or the gestation period. The embryo (the baby) within the womb of the mother during pregnancy is called <span class="highlight01"> foetus </span>.
			When the foetus is a complete baby with all the organs, the mother gives birth to it.

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Characters from parents to Children</h3>
	<p> Fertilization is the process in which the sperm cell from the father fuses with the egg cell from the mother to form a zygote. The nucleus in each sperm and egg has chromosomes. These chromosomes on the sperm carry the characters of father and the chromosomes on the egg carry the characters of the mother. When these chromosomes unite in pairs in a zygote, they transfer the characters to the new baby. The baby therefore inherits some characteristics from the father and some from the mother. The children, therefore, resemble their parents in body features and also in habits. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">The Sex of the Baby </h3>
	<p> The chromosomes in the sperm, except for one. In each egg there are 23 chromosomes of which 22 are similar to that of a sperm and the 23rd may be different. We describe this 23rd chromosome in egg as X chromosome. All eggs carry X-chromosome only. In some of the sperms the 23rd chromosome may be an X chromosome and in some it may be a Y chromosome. X and Y chromosomes are "sex chromosomes". <br />
		<span class="highlight01">Xchromosome </span> stands for <span class="highlight01"> female </span> and <span class="highlight01"> Y chromosome for male character </span>. When an egg is fertilized by sperm having Xchromosome, the zygote is XX, and the baby developing from it is a female baby (a girl child). When an egg is fertilized by sperm having Y chromosome, the zygote is XY, and the baby developing from it is a male baby (a boy child). Sex of the child depends upon the sex chromosome present in the sperm fertilizing the egg. Thus, sperm from the <span class="highlight01"> father is responsible for the sex of the child </span>.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Gender Issues </h4>
		<p> Many people blame the mother for giving birth to a girl. Do you think it is true? In many tribes the
			people have a disliking for having a girl child because of social reasons. They seek the help from doctors for determining the sex of the foetus while inside the mother's womb. In case, the foetus happens to be female they get it aborted (killing of the foetus inside the mother's womb). This practice is called female infanticide. Government has made it illegal to find out the sex of the foetus to put a stop to the female infanticide.

					<span class="highlight01"> Reproductive functioning </span> begins with the maturation of sex organs and with the secretion of Follicle Stimlating Hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. This makes the ova (eggs) maturein the ovaries and preparing the uterus to receive zygote. In girls puberty begins at the age of 10 to 12 years. <br />
					During puberty, ova begin to mature in the ovaries. One ovum from any one of the two ovaries is released into the fallopian tube once in about 28 to 30 days. The sperm from male joins the ovum in the fallopian tube to form zygote. The zygote moves into the uterus and gets attached to the spongy and cushiony wall formed in the uterus. This is the onset (beginning) of pregnancy.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Before a zygote is received in the uterus, the uterus wall becomes thick with a lining of soft and spongy tissue full of blood vessels. This is to receive the zygote. In case fertilization does not take place, the ovum (egg) along with the lining and the blood vessels is shed off. This results in bleeding in women which continues for 2 to 3 days. This is called menstruation. Since menstruation occurs once in about 28 to 30 days it is also called <span class="highlight01"> "period" or menstrual cycle </span>. First menstrual flow is called menarche and begins with puberty. At the age of 45 to 50 years the reproductive
					ability stops and then menstrual cycle also stops. Stoppage of menstruation is called <span class="highlight01">  menopause </span>, which is the termination of puberty.

	<h3 class="skill-heading"> Gender Issues and Social Taboos </h3>
	<p> It has been since times immemoriable that the man became selfish and he discriminated against the "fair sex", the girls or the female child. <br />
		Since women were more apt to work in homes and fie they were kept occupied as labour and man used to be busy whiling away his time in gossiping am in games. To be exact 'most men lived as parasite on women'. She was the bread earner. One used to keep many wives. Even today when the law is 'one man one wife', in certain tribal societies they permit man to keep more than one wife. <br />
		In contrast, in many of our social groups, girls are considered a burden since marrying them subjugates is them to the families in which their sisters or daughters are married. Whereas, in some social groups "dowry" has become a menace. To overcome all this, "female foeticide" has become a practice. Overall result is that in some areas the female population is on the decline. There are less number of girls available to marry the boys. <br />
		We must leave things for nature to decide. Chance combination of X and Y sperms with ova when left to nature automatically results in balancing the population of the two sexes. Then, we must respect WOMEN, since only they help in bringing up of babies, and not the man. Today, women have been able to do better than men in every field of life.
