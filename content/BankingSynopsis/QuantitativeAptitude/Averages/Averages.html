	<p>The result obtained by adding several quantities together and then dividing this total by the number of quantities is called Average. The main term of average is equal sharing of a value among all, where it may share persons or things. We obtain the average of a number using formula that is sum of observations divide by Number of observations. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Formula 1:</span>
		<br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Average = \frac{\text{Sum of observations}}{\text{Number of observations}}.  \) </span>
		<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Ex: </span> There are Five Numbers, we are going to calculate the average of  29, 31, 33, 37, 49. <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  Average = \frac{(29 + 31 + 33 + 37 + 49 )}{5}  \\\\[3pt]
		= \frac{179}{5} =  35.8  \end{align}  \) </span>.
		<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Formula 2: </span>
		<br />
			Average of first n natural numbers = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{n + 1}{2}.  \) </span>
		<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Formula 3: </span>  Average of first n square natural numbers =  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}.  \) </span>
		<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Formula 4: </span> Average of first n cube natural numbers = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{(n)(n + 1)^2}{4}.  \) </span>
		<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Formula 5: </span> Average of first n even numbers = (n + 1) <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Formula 6: </span> Average of first n odd numbers = n </p>

			average of six nos = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{\text{Sum of observations}}{\text{Number of observations}} = \) </span>
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{\text{sum of 6 nos}}{6}  \) </span> = 18  <br />
			sum of 6 nos = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (18 \times 6)  \) </span>
			<br />
			similarly, the sum of four nos = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (12 \times 4)  \) </span>
			<br />
			the sum of remaining two  nos = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (18 \times 6)-(12 \times 4) = 108 - 48 =60  \) </span>
			<br />
		the average of remaining two number = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{\text{Sum of observations}}{\text{Number of observations}} =  \) </span>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
		<p>What would be the average of first 20 natural numbers ? </p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			Sum of first n natural numbers<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}  \) </span>

		<p> In a college  out of 30 students, 16 girls has the average age is 18 years and 14 boys has the average age 17 years. What would be the average age of entire college ?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">
					 Answer:</span>

			<br />
		the average age of 16 girls is 18 years. So,the sum of their ages = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (16 \times 18)  = 288  \) </span>
			<br />
		4 boys has the average age 17 years . The sum of their ages =<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ( 14 \times 17 ) = 238  \) </span>
			<br />
		Average age is = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac {288 + 238}{30} = \frac{526}{30}  \) </span>  = 17.54 years</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 4:</h4>
		<p>The average of five numbers is 64.6. The average of first and second numbers is 66 and the average of 4th and 5th number is 86. Find the third number.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">
					Answer:</span> 
			<br />
		The average of five numbers is 64.6.the sum of 5 nos = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (64.6 \times 5)  = 323  \) </span>
			<br />
		The average of first two numbers is 66.their sum = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (66 \times 2)  = 132  \) </span>
			<br />
		The average of last two nos is 86.their sum = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (86 \times 2)  = 172  \) </span>
			<br />
		3rd number is = 323 - (132 + 172) = 323 - 304 = 19.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 5:</h4>
		<p>The average salary of 25 employee in a company per month is Rs.6000. If the salary of manager's is added than the salary is increase is Rs. 6500. What would be the salary of the manager's ?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
		average salary of employee in company is = 6000<br />
		when added one member salry increased = 6500. <br />
		formula when increased: ( previous avg salary ) + [(increased avg salary ) <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> ( no. of persons including new persons)]
