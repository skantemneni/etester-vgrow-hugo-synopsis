	<h3 class="skill-heading">Ratio</h3>
	<p>The ratio of two quantities of the same kind and in the same units is a comparison by division of the measure of two quantities. <br />
		In other words, ratio of two quantities of the same kind is the relation between their measures and determines how many times the one quantity is greater than or less than the other quantity. <br />
		Thus the ratio of a to b is the fraction <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{a}{b}  \) </span> and is generally written as a:b. <br />
		<span class="highlight01">Ex: </span>
		<br />
		The ratio of Rs.50 to Rs.75 is 50 : 75 or 2 : 3. <br />
		<span class="highlight01">Ex:</span>
		<br />
		The ratio of 4m to 160 cm is 400 : 160 or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{400}{160}  \) </span> or 5 : 2. <br />
		<span class="highlight01">Ex:</span>
		<br />
		There is no ratio between 3 metres and Rs. 10. <br />
		<span class="highlight01">Note:</span>
		<br />
		Since the ratio of two quantities of the same kind determines how many times one quantity is contained by the other, so the ratio of any two quantities of the same kind is an abstract quantity. In other words, ratio has no unit or it is independent of the units used in the quantities compared. <br />
		For the ratio a : b, the quantities a and b are called terms of the ratio. The former 'a' is called the first term or antecedent and the latter 'b' is known as the second term or consequent. <br />
		The value of ratio remains the same, if both the antecedent and the consequent are multiplied or divided by the same non-zero quantity, because for any non-zero m, <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{ma}{mb} \ \Rightarrow \ a : b \) </span> is same as ma : mb and  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{\frac{a}{m}}{\frac{b}{m}} \ \Rightarrow \ a : b  \) </span> is same as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{a}{m} : \frac{b}{m}  \) </span>

				<p>If two ratios are equal, they make a proportion or the quality of two ratios constitutes a proportion. Thus <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6}  \) </span> or 2 : 3 = 4 : 6 or 2 : 3 :: 4 : 6 and is read as "2 is to 3 as 4 is to 6". <br />
					Each term of the ratio <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{2}{3} \ and \ \frac{4}{6}  \) </span>  is called a proportional. They are respectively the first, second, third and fourth proportionals. In the proportion, 2 : 3 : : 4 : 6, the end terms 2 and 6 are called extremes and the middle terms 3 and 4 are called means. Now the  above proportionals can be written as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6} \ or \ 2 \times 6 = 3 \times 4  \) </span>
					<br />
					Hence, the product of the means = the product of the extremes. Take another proportion, say, <br />
					3 : 5 :: 21 : 35 <br />
					Since <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3 \times 35 = 5 \times 21  \) </span>, the result is true that the product of the means = product of the extremes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Continued Proportion:</span> : Consider the proportion 4, 6, 9. Here <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{4}{6} = \frac{6}{9}  \) </span> or the ratio of the first to second is equal to the ratio of the second to the third. <br />
					Thus 4, 6, 9 are in the Continued Proportion.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If a : b :: c : x, x is called the fourth proportion of a, b, c. <br />
					We have <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( a \times x = b \times c \ or \ x = \frac{b \times c}{a}  \) </span>
					<br />
					Thus fourth proportion of a, b, c is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{b \times c }{a}  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If a : b :: b : x, x is called the third proportion of a, b. <br />
					we have <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a \times x = b \times b \ or \ x = \frac{b^2}{a}  \) </span>. <br />
					Thus third proportion of a, b is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{b^2}{a}  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If a : x :: x : b, x is called the mean or second proportion of a, b. <br />
