		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 3:</h4>
		<p>A fisherman running upstream and covers 16km and running downstream and covers 28km taking 6 hours each time. Find the velocity of water current.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			fisherman running speed in still water is u km/hr. <br />
			Speed of of current is v km/hr <br />
			So, Speed of downstream is (u + v) <br />
			Speed of upstream is (u - v) <br />
			So, 6(u - v) = 16 and 6(u + v) = 28 <br />
			6u + 6v = 28 <br />
			6u  - 6v = 16 <br />
			Subtracting we get <br />
			12v = 12 <br />
			v = 1 km/hr. </p>

			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			24 minutes converted into hr = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \frac{24}{60} \) </span> hr  <br />
			so, Speed of boy upstream 4 km in 24 minutes = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \frac{4 \times 60}{24} = 10 km/hr. \) </span>
			<br />

			Speed of boy downstream 4 km in 20 minutes = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \frac{4 \times 60}{20} = 12 km/hr. \) </span>
			<br />
			So, Rate of current is : <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{2} (downstream - upstream) =  \frac{1}{2}(12 - 10) = 1 \frac{km}{hr}. \) </span>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 5:</h4>

		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			Speed downstream = (18 + 6) km/hr = 24 km/hr. <br />

		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			12 - 4 = 8(Speed of upstream) <br />
			12 + 4 = 16(speed of downstream) <br />
