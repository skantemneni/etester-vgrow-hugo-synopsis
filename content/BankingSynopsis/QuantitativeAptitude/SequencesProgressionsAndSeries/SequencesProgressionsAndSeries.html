	<p>A "sequence" (or "progression", in British English) is an ordered list of numbers; the numbers in this ordered list are called "elements" or "terms". A "series" is the value you get when you add up all the terms of a sequence; this value is called the "sum". For instance, "1, 2, 3, 4" is a sequence, with terms "1", "2", "3", and "4"; the corresponding series is the sum "1 + 2 + 3 + 4", and the value of the series is 10. <br />
		A sequence may be named or referred to as "A" or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  A_n  \) </span>. The terms of a sequence are usually named something like <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( a_i  \) </span> or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_n  \) </span>, with the subscripted letter "i" or "n" being the "index" or counter. So the second term of a sequnce might be named <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_2  \) </span> (pronounced "ay-sub-two"), and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_{12}  \) </span> would designate the twelfth term. <br />
		<span class="highlight01">Note: </span> Sometimes sequences start with an index of n = 0, so the first term is actually <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_0  \) </span>. Then the second term would be <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_1  \) </span> . The first listed term in such a case would be called the "zero-eth" term. This method of numbering the terms is used, for example, in Javascript arrays. Don't assume that every sequence and series will start with an index of n = 1. <br />
		A sequence A with terms <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_n  \) </span> may also be referred to as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \{a_n \}  \) </span>, but contrary to what you may have learned in other contexts, this "set" is actually an ordered list, not an unordered collection of elements. (Your book may use some notation other than what I'm showing here. Unfortunately, notation doesn't yet seem to have been entirely standardized for this topic. Just try always to make sure, whatever resource you're using, that you are clear on the definitions of that resource's terms and symbols.) <br />
		To indicate a series, we use either the Latin capital letter "S" or else the Greek letter corresponding to the capital "S", which is called "sigma" (SIGG-muh): <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sum  \) </span>
		<br />
		To show the summation of, say, the first through tenth terms of a sequence <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \{a_n \}  \) </span> , we would write the following: <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sum\limits_{n = 1}^{10} {a_n}  \) </span>
		<br />
		The "n = 1" is the "lower index", telling us that "n" is the counter and that the counter starts at "1"; the "10" is the "upper index", telling us that <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_{10}  \) </span>  will be the last term added in this series; <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_n  \) </span> stands for the terms that we'll be adding. The whole thing is pronounced as "the sum, from n equals one to ten, of a-sub-n". The summation symbol above means the following: <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_1  + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 + a_{10}  \) </span>
		<br />
		The written-out form above is called the "expanded" form of the series, in contrast with the more compact "sigma" notation. <br />
		Any letter can be used for the index, but i, j, k, and n are probably used more than any other letters. <br />
		Sequences and series are most useful when there is a formula for their terms. For instance, if the formula for an is "2n + 3", then you can find the value of any term by plugging the value of n into the formula. For instance, a8 = 2(8) + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19. In words, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_n = 2n + 3  \) </span> can be read as "the n-th term is given by two-enn plus three". The word "n-th" is pronounced "ENN-eth", and just means "the generic term an, where I haven't yet specified the value of n."<br />
		Of course, there doesn't have to be a formula for the n-th term of a sequence. The values of the terms can be utterly random, having no relationship between n and the value of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( a_n  \) </span>. But sequences with random terms are hard to work with and are less useful in general, so you're not likely to see many of them in your classes.</p>

		<p>Let <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( A_n  \) </span> = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} . What is the value of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_3  \) </span>? <br />

			The index of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_3  \) </span> is n = 3, so they're asking me for the third term, which is "5".

			<br />

			<br />

	<section class="solved-example">
		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
		<p>
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{5}{6 + 3} + \frac{5}{7 + 3} + \frac{5}{8 + 3} + ..... + \frac{5}{31 + 3}  \) </span>

			<br />
			The only thing that changes from one term to the next is one of the numbers in the denominator. (If I "simplify" these fractions, I'll lose this information. Any time the terms of my sequence or series look oddly lumpy, I tend not to simplify those terms: that odd lumpiness almost certainly contains a hint of the pattern I need to find.) The changing numbers, as a list, are 6, 7, and 8. This looks like counting, but starting with 6 instead of 1. Without any information to the contrary, I'll assume that this is the pattern. <br />
			But I need to relate these "counting" values to the counter, the index, n. For n = 1, the number is 6, or n + 5. For n = 2, the number is 7, which is also n + 5. Checking the pattern for n = 3, 3 + 5 = 8, which is the third number. Then the terms seems to be in the following pattern: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{5}{(n + 5) + 3}  \) </span>
			<br />
			But how many terms are in the summation? The ellipsis (the "..." or "dot, dot, dot" in the middle) means that terms were omitted. However, now that I have the general pattern for the series terms, I can solve for the counter (the value of n) in the last term: <br />
			31 = n + 5  <br />
			31 - 5 = n + 5 - 5  <br />
			n = 26  <br />
			This tells me that there are 26 terms in this summation, so the series, in summation notation, is: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sum\limits_{n = 1}^{26} \frac{5}{(n + 5) + 3}  \) </span>
			<br />
			If the fractions (above) had been simplified and reduced, it would have been a lot harder to figure out a pattern. Unless the sequence is very simple or is presented in a very straightforward manner, it is possible that you won't be able to find a pattern, or might find a "wrong" pattern. Don't let this bother you terribly much: the "right" pattern is just the one that the author had in mind when he wrote the problem. Your pattern would be "wrong" only in that it is unexpected. But if you can present your work sensibly and mathematically, you should be able to talk your way into getting at least partial credit for your answer. <br />
			Once you've learned the basic notation and terminology, you should quickly move on to the two common and straightforward sequence types....</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 3:</h4>
		<p>Find the common difference and the next term of the following sequence: <br />
			3, 11, 19, 27, 35,...</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Sol:</span>
			<br />
			To find the common difference, I have to subtract a pair of terms. It doesn't matter which pair I pick, as long as they're right next to each other: <br />
			11 - 3 = 8 <br />
			19 - 11 = 8 <br />
			27 - 19 = 8 <br />
			35 - 27 = 8 <br />
			The difference is always 8, so d = 8. Then the next term is 35 + 8 = 43.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 4:</h4>
		<p>Evaluate <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( S_{10}  \) </span> for 250, 100, 40, 16,....</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Sol:</span>
			<br />
			The notation <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  S_{10}  \) </span> means that I need to find the sum of the first ten terms. The first term is a = 250. Dividing pairs of terms, I get <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  100 \div 250 = \frac{2}{5}, \ 40 \div 100 = \frac{2}{5}  \) </span> , etc, so the terms being added form a geometric sequence with common ratio <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( r = \frac{2}{5}  \) </span>. When I plug in the values of the first term and the common ratio, the summation formula gives me: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align} S_{10} = 250 \left ( \frac{1 - \left ( \frac{2}{5} \right )^{10} }{1 - \frac{2}{5}} \right )  \\\\[3pt]
				= 250 \left ( \frac{1 - \frac{1024}{9765625}}{\frac{3}{5}} \right )  \\\\[3pt]
				= 250 \left ( \frac{9764601}{9765625} \right ) \left ( \frac{5}{3} \right )  \\\\[3pt]
				= \frac{250}{1} \left ( \frac{3254867}{1953125} \right )  \\\\[3pt]
				= \frac{6509734}{15625} = S_{10} = \frac{6509734}{15625}   \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Note:</span> If you try to do the above computations in your calculator, it may very well return the decimal approximation of 416.62297... instead of the fractional (and exact) answer. As you can see in the screen-capture to the right, entering the values in fractional form and using the "convert to fraction" command still results in just a decimal approximation to the answer. But (warning!) the decimal approximation will almost certain be regarded as a "wrong" answer! Take the time to find the fractional form!</p>
