				<p>As a matter of fact, alligation may be understood as a rule that enables us

							<p>to find out the mean or average value of mixture when the prices of two or more ingredients which may be mixed together and the proportion in which they are mixed are given. This is known as 'Alligation Medial'.</p>

							<p>to find out the proportion in which two ingredients of the same nature of given prices should be mixed so as to produce a mixture worth a desired price: This is known as 'Alligation Alternate'. <br />
								It should be noted that the value of the mixture can't be lower than the cheaper value and higher than the dearer.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Explanation of Alligation Rule : </h4>
		<p>We may very well understand the above rule with the help of an example given below : <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Example </span>
			<br />
			In what ratio should ghee worth Rs. 30 per kg and ghee worth Rs. 45 per kg. be mixed so as to get a mixture worth Rs. 40 per kg ? <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> sol </span>
			<br />
			The price per kg. of cheaper ghee is Rs. 10 less than the rate of the mixture. The price per kg. of dearer ghee is Rs. 5 more than the rate of the mixture. <br />
			Hence it is obvious that every 1 kg. of cheaper ghee will result in a profit of Rs. 10 and every 1 kg of dearer ghee will result in a loss of Rs. 5.<br />
			If we wish to have the mixture worth the desired rate, then the profit and loss should equalise, i.e., the gain on cheaper ghee must be equal to the loss on the dearer ghee so that there will be neither gain or loss by selling the mixture at Rs. 45/kg.<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore \left( \text{No.of kg of cheaper ghee} \right) \times Rs.10  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = \left( \text{No.of kg of cheaper ghee} \right) \times Rs.5  \) </span>
			<br />
			i.e <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{ \text{No.of kg of cheaper ghee}}{ \text{No.of kg of dearer ghee}}  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Hence the two ghee's should be mixed in the ratio of 1 : 2.Thus the alligation rule is established.</p>
