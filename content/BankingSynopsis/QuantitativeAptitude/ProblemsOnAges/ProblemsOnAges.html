		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 1:</h4>
		<p>The ratio of present age of Asha and Bikash is 2 : 4 the present age of Asha is 30 years. What would be the age of Bikash after 6 years?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			Asha:Bikash present age ratio is 2:4 and Asha present age = 30 years. <br />
			Bikash present age is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{30 \times 2}{2} = 60 \ years  \) </span>. <br />
			Bikash age after 6 years is 60 + 6 = 66 years.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 3:</h4>
		<p>Suman and Bivash is 50 years old and 70 years old. How many years before was the ratio of their ages 3 : 5?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			Their ratio was 3 : 5, y years before, <br />
			So, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{50 - y}{70} = \frac{3}{5}  \) </span>
			<br />
			5(50 - y) = 3(70 - y) = 250 - 5y = 210 - 3y = 2y = 40 = y = 20 years.</p>

		<p>Ajay and Bijoy of their present ages of ratio is 4 : 5, 6 years later their ages becomes 14 : 17. Find the present age of Ajay's?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{4x + 6}{5x + 6} = \frac{14}{17}  \) </span>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 6:</h4>
		<p>Lahiri is much younger than partha as he is older than kunal. If the sum of ages of partha and kunal is 65 years. Find the present age of lahiri?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			(Patha - Lahiri) = X .....(i) <br />
			(Lahiri - Kunal) = X ......(ii) <br />
			So, we get from (i) and (ii) <br />
			Partha - Kunal = 2X <br />
			and Partha + Kunal = 65 <br />
			We can say that it can't be determined.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 8:</h4>
		<p> Rahul would be thric in 12 years as like sanjay was 12 years ago, Now Rahul is 6 years senior the sanjay, what is the present age of sanjay?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			Let sanjay present age is x years. <br />
			So, Rahul present age is (x + 6). <br />
			(x + 6) + 12 = 3(x - 12) <br />
			12x + 72 = 3x - 36 <br />
			12x - 3x = -36 - 72 <br />
			9x = 108 <br />
			x = 12 <br />
			The present age of sanjay 12 years.</p>

			<span class="highlight01">Answer:</span>
			<br />
			Let 10 years before gangotri, sabir, and bibhas ages 3x, 4x, 5x years respectively.<br />
			Then (2x + 10) + (4x + 10) + (5x + 10) = 96 = 11x = 66 = x = 6. <br />
			Bibhas present age is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (5x + 10) = (5 \times 6 + 10) = 40 \ years  \) </span>
