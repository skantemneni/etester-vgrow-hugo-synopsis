	<p> The method of solving the questions on pipes and cistern is almost same as that of solving the questions of Time and Work, but with a bit difference as negative work, comes into play due to leakage of pipes and cistern. </p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 1:</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> Question:</span>
			<br />
			A water reservoir can fill by a tap in 12 hours and leakage can vacant that water reservoir by tap in 18 hours. if the tap of a water reservoir fill and opened simultaneously, then what time will it takes to be filled.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{12} - \frac{1}{18} = \frac{1}{36}  \) </span>
			<br />
			In <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{36}  \) </span> time will takes to be filled.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> Question:</span>
			<br />
			Two pipes A and B can fill a water reservoir in 12 hours and 14 hours respectively while a third pipe C empties the full water reservoir in 30 hours. If all the A, B, C operate simultaneously, How much time will take be filled the water reservoir ?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Step 1: Net part filled by 1 hour = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left( \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{14} \right) - \frac{1}{30} = \frac{51}{40}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Step 2: The time taken will fill the water reservoir is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{420}{51}  \) </span> = 8 hr 12 minutes. <br />
			So, time taken to fill the water reservoir 8 hr 12 minutes.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 3:</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> Question:</span>
			<br />
			Two pipes that pipe 1 and pipe 2 can fill a water reservoir in 36 hours and 45 hours respectively. If both the pipes are simultaneously, how much time will be taken to fill the water reservoir ?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Here both pipes are filled so we can easily say it is a positive.<br />
			Step 1: So at first of we calculate fill pipe in 1 hours time taken. <br />
			pipe 1 + pipe 2 together filled a water reservoir in 1 hour = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left( \frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{45} \right) = \frac{9}{180} = \frac{1}{20}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Step 2: So in 1 hour it fill with <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{20}  \) </span>
			<br />
			hence time taken both the pipe 1 and pipe 2 will fill the water reservoir in 20 hours.</p>

			<span class="highlight01"> Question:</span>
			<br />
			Two pipes that pipe 1 and pipe 2 can fill a water reservoir in 3 hours and 6 hours respectively. Pipe 3 can empty it in 12 hours. If all the three pipes are opened together, then the water reservoir will be filled in:</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Net part filled in 1 hour = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{12} \right) = \frac{5}{12}  \) </span>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 5:</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> Question:</span>
			<br />
			If A pipe can fill a water reservoir in 12 Hr, and pipes B can empty a water reservoir in 20 Hr, when both pipes are opened simultaneously, How much time will be taken to fill the water reservoir ?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Step 1: At we calculate time taken to fill in hour <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{12}  \) </span> hr and time taken to empty the water reservior in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{20}  \) </span> hr <br />
			Step 2: When both pipes are opened then time taken to fill <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{12} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{5 - 3}{60}  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{2}{60} = \frac{1}{30}  \) </span>
			<br />
			So in 1 hour to take fill tank both are open A and B <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{30}  \) </span>
			<br />
			time taken when A and B are opened, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  A + B = \frac{30}{1} = 30 \ Hr  \) </span>
