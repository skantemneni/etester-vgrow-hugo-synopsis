				<p>'Interest' is the money paid.by a borrower to the lender for the use of money borrowed.</p>

			<li>
				<p>The money borrowed or lent out for a certain period is called the 'Principal' or 'the sum'.</p>

			<li>
				<p>The interest is charged according to some pre condition which is expressed in general as a rate per cent of the principal for each year and is called 'rate percent per annum'. Thus if the rate of interest is 5% per annum, it means that the interest on principal of Rs.100 for one year is Rs. 5. <br />

				<p>We have learnt earlier that if Principal = RS. P, Rate = R % per annum and Time = T years then the simple interest is given by the formula <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  S.I = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}  \) </span>
					<br />
					Clearly, when money is borrowed on simple interest then the interest is calculated uniformly on the original principal throughout the loan period. <br />
					However, in post offices, banks, insurance corporations and the other money lending and deposit taking companies, the method of calculating interest is quite different. <br />
					Under this method, the borrower and the lender agree to fix up a certain unit of time say yearly or half yearly or quarterly, to settle the previous account. <br />
					In such cases, the interest accured during the first unit of time is added to the original principal and the amount so obtained is taken as the Principal for the second unit of time. The Amount of this Principal at the end of second unit of time becomes the Principal for the third unit of time and so on. <br />
					After a certain specified period, the difference between the Amount and the money borrowed is called the Compounf Interest (C.I.) for that period.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The fixed unit of time is known as conversion period.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Let us take an example to explain the process. Let us suppose Rs.1000 is lent for 2 years at 10%. <br />
					Obviously, <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( S.I = \frac{1000 \times 2 \times 10}{100} = Rs.200.  \) </span>
					<br />
					Hence, amount after 2 years under S.I = Rs.1000 + Rs.200 = Rs.1200. <br />
					Now, interest on Rs.1000 at 10% after 1 year. <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = \frac{1000 \times 10 \times 1}{100} = Rs.100  \) </span>
					<br />
					Under C.I. this interest will be added to the original principal i.e. Rs.1000 so that the amount after 1 year = Rs. 1000 + Rs. 100. i.e. Rs. 1100. This amount becomes the principal for the 2nd year. Now, interest on Rs. 1100 at 10% for 1 year <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = \frac{1100 \times 10 \times 1}{100} = Rs.110  \) </span>
					<br />
					Hence, amount after 2 years <br />
					= Rs.1100 + Rs.110 = Rs.1210 <br />
					It is the final amount. <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> C.I. = Final amount - Original amount = Rs. (1210 - 1000) = Rs.210 </p>

							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>If the interest is payable half-yearly, then time is multiplied by 2 and the rate is halved. <br />

							<p>When interest is compounded annually but time is in fraction, say <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  5 \frac{2}{3}  \) </span> years, then <br />
