	<p>Certain general rules are given below. The candidates will find them quite useful while solving problems related to Time and Work.</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>While solving problems related to Time and Work we have to compare the work of several working agents (men, women on children).<br />
					To solve this purpose, we need find out the amount of work done by each agent in a common unit time. This unit time is generally taken as an hour, one minute or one day depending upon the nature of the problem.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The total work is assumed to be 1.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If one can do a piece of work in 15 days, then it means that he can do <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{15}  \) </span> of work in 1 day </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Conversely, if one can do <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{15}  \) </span> work in 1 day, it implies that he can complete the work in 15 days.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>One day's work <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = \frac{1}{ \text{No.of days required to finish the work}}  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>No. of days required to finish the work <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{ \text{One day's work}}  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If A does <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{10}  \) </span> of work in 1 day and B does <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{15}  \) </span> of the same work in 1 day then A + B together will do <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{15}  \) </span> i.e., <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{6}  \) </span> of that work in 1 day </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If A is thrice as good as a workman as B then <br />
					A's work : B's work = 3 : 1 <br />
					and ratio of the times taken by A and B to complete the work = 1 : 3 i.e. A. will take <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{3}  \) </span> of the time taken by B to complete that work.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The time required to complete a certain piece of work is increased (or decreased) in the same ratio in which the number of men engaged to do that piece of work is decreased (or increased).<br />
					For example, if the number of men engaged to do a piece of work be changed in the ratio 4 : 5, the time required to complete that piece of work will change in the ratio 5:4.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Time and number of men each are always in direct proportion to work. All the above points can be summarised as given below : <br />
					If <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( 'M_1'  \) </span> persons can do <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  'W1'  \) </span> works in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  'D_1'  \) </span> days and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( 'M_2'  \) </span> persons can do <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  'W_2'  \) </span> works in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  'D_2'  \) </span> days then we have a very general formula in the relationship of <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  M_1 D_1 W_2 = M_2 D_2 W_1  \) </span>
					<br />
					It is an all in one formula and basic formula. We can also conclude that <br />
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>More men less days and conversely more days less men.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>More men more work and conversely more work more men.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>More days more work and conversely more work more days.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If 'A' can do a piece of work in x days and 'B' can do it in y days then 'A' and 'B' working together can do the same work in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{xy}{x + y}  \) </span> days. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If A, B and C can do a work in x, y and z days respectively then all of them working together can finish the work in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{xyz}{xy + yz.xz}  \) </span> days.</p>
			</li>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> Speed: </span> Speed is the distance covered by an object per unit time. <br />
					Thus, if a person travels a distance of 25 kilometres in 5 hours, then his speed is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  5 \frac{km}{hour}.  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Distance = Speed \times Time  \) </span>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Speed = \frac{Distance}{Time}  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Time = \frac{Distance}{Speed}  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>However, one has to remember the units of expression. Generally if the distance is in km, we measure time in hours and speed in <span class="highlight01"> km per hour </span> and is written as km.<br />
					per/hr and if distance is in metre then time is taken in seconds and speed in metre per second and written as mpsec. To bring uniformity in given data, it is required to remember the conversion factor of speed.<br />
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p> To convert the speed given in the <span class="highlight01"> kmph </span> to <span class="highlight01"> Metre per/sec </span>. We multiply it by a factor <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{5}{18}  \) </span>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>To convert the speed given in <span class="highlight01"> Metre per/sec </span>. to <span class="highlight01"> Km. per/hr., </span> we divide it by a factor <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{5}{18}  \) </span> or multiply by a factor <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{18}{5}  \) </span>.<br />
								More clearly, 1 kmph = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1 \ km}{1 \ hour}  \) </span>
								<br />
								<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = \frac{1000 \ m}{60 \times 60 \ sec} = \frac{5}{18} \ m/sec  \) </span>
								<br />
								Thus, a speed of 18 kilometres per hour = A speed of 5 metres per second </p>

				<p>The speed of a body relative to the other body is called its relative speed.</p>

			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{12} - \frac{1}{18} = \frac{1}{36}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Speed of Suresh car = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{360}{8} = 45 \frac{km}{hr}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Speed of Ramesh car = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{405}{9} = 45 \frac{km}{hr}  \) </span>
			<br />
			So, sum of both cars speed = (45 + 45) = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  90 \frac{km}{hrs}  \) </span>

			<span class="highlight01"> Question:</span>
			<br />
			A boy without any stoppage running on a road at an average speed of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  80 \frac{km}{hr}  \) </span>, and with stoppage he covers the same distance at an average speed of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  60 \frac{km}{hr}  \) </span>. How many minutes per hour does boy stop ?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Let the total distance cover by boy on road is x km .<br />
			Time take to complete at a speed of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  80 \frac{km}{hours} = \frac{x}{80}  \) </span> hours .<br />
			Time take to complete at a speed of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  80 \frac{km}{hours} = \frac{x}{60}  \) </span> hours .<br /> hours .<br />
			So he stop to rest <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left( \frac{x}{80} - \frac{x}{60}  \right) hours = \frac{20 x}{60 \times 80} = \frac{x}{240} \ hours.  \) </span>
			<br />
			So he rest per hour =  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{ \frac{x}{240}}{ \frac{x}{60}} = \frac{x}{240} \times \frac{60}{x} = \frac{1}{4} \ hours = 15 \ minutes  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Shortcut Tricks :</span>
			<br />
			Time of rest per hour = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left( \frac{ \text{Difference of speed}}{ \text{Speed without stopage}} \right)  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{(80 - 60)}{80} = \frac{1}{4} = 15 \ minutes  \) </span>
