		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Random Access Memory (RAM):</h4>
		<p>It is computer's primary working memory in which program instructions and data are stored so that they can be accessed directly by the CPU via processor's high speed external data bus. RAM is often called Read/Write Memory. In RAM-CPU can read and write data. RAM does not retain its contents when the power to the computer is switched off.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Types of RAM and their background of usage:</h4>
		<p>Till a decade ago, the only type of RAM available was DRAM (Dynamic RAM), so named because it changes its content constantly. Specifically the DRAM then available was EDO-RAM (Extended Data-Out DRAM); while the RAM was working on current bit, it was already extending its reach for the next bit.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">EDROM</h4>
		<p>was replaced by SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM) in 1990's. In this, the access speed was increased over the earlier EDO-RAM. At present most of the computers use it. <br />
			However in 1998, a radically different technology of RAM called-RDRAM (Rambus DRAM) came in which some architectural modifications were done to increase the speed. All the Pentium-4 PC's are tied with RDRAM. But this RAM is quite expensive.<br />
			In 2000, a new variant of SDRAM that offers faster performance, comparable to RDRAM, and price closer to SDRAM was launched which is called DDR-RAM (Double Data Rate-RAM).</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Software</h3>
	<p>Software brings life into the computer. It is nothing but instrutions (or a program) required to run the computer. It guides the hardware how to do its job. A computer is otherwise a general-purpose machine. It is software which differentiates among the various kinds of jobs a computer can perform. Software consists of ectronics instruction. A specific set of instructions that drive a computer to perform a specific task is called a Program. When a computer is using a particular program, it is said to be running or executing that program. <br />
		Microsolt, WordPerfect, Ami pro for Windows are few of the Windows-based word-processors available in the market. Oracle, Ingres, Informix, Unify are some of the commercially available Rational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) packages. Auto CAD has been the most famous drafting package and it works on the Windows platform. Diagnostic are the programs used to diagnose the problems of your computers. These are very important programs and are able to rectify the problems of your computer to a certain exterit by the programmer itself. Typical examples of such programs are Scan Disk, Smart Dog and Nortan Utilities etc. Coreldraw, PowerPoint and Persuaion are the Presentation Graphics or Business Graphic Packages which works in the Windows environment.</p>
