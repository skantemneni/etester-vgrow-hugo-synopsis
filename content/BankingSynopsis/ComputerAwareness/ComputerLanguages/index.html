	<h3 class="skill-heading">Computer Languages</h3>
	<p>Computer Languages any of various languages for expressing a set of detailed instructions for a digital computer. Such instructions can be executed directly when they are in the computer manufacturer-specific numerical form known as machine language, after a simple substitution process when expressed in a corresponding assembly language, or after translation from some "higher-level" language. Although there are over 2,000 computer languages, relatively few are widely used.<br />
		Machine and assembly languages are "low-level," requiring a programmer to manage explicitly all of a computer's idiosyncratic features of data storage and operation. In contrast, high-level languages shield a programmer from worrying about such considerations and provide a notation that is more easily written and read by programmers. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Machine and assembly languages</h4>
		<p>A machine language consists of the numeric codes for the operations that a particular computer can execute directly. The codes are strings of 0s and 1s, or binary digits ("bits"), which are frequently converted both from and to hexadecimal (base 16) for human viewing and modification. Machine language instructions typically use some bits to represent operations, such as addition, and some to represent operands, or perhaps the location of the next instruction. Machine language is difficult to read and write, since it does not resemble conventional mathematical notation or human language, and its codes vary from computer to computer. <br />
		Assembly language is one level above machine language. It uses short mnemonic codes for instructions and allows the programmer to introduce names for blocks of memory that hold data. One might thus write "add pay, total" instead of "0110101100101000" for an instruction that adds two numbers. <br />
		Assembly language is designed to be easily translated into machine language. Although blocks of data may be referred to by name instead of by their machine addresses, assembly language does not provide more sophisticated means of organizing complex information. Like machine language, assembly language requires detailed knowledge of internal computer architecture. It is useful when such details are important, as in programming a computer to interact with input or output devices (printers, scanners, storage devices, and so forth).</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Algorithmic languages</h4>
		<p>Algorithmic languages are designed to express mathematical or symbolic computations. They can express algebraic operations in notation similar to mathematics and allow the use of subprograms that package commonly used operations for reuse. They were the first high-level languages.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Fortran</h5>
		<p>The first important algorithmic language was FORTRAN (formula translation), designed in 1957 by an IBM team led by John Backus. It was intended for scientific computations with real numbers and collections of them organized as one- or multidimensional arrays. Its control structures included conditional IF statements, repetitive loops (so-called DO loops), and a GOTO statement that allowed nonsequential execution of program code. FORTRAN made it convenient to have subprograms for common mathematical operations, and built libraries of them. <br />
			FORTRAN was also designed to translate into efficient machine language. It was immediately successful and continues to evolve.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Algol</h5>
		<p>ALGOL (algorithmic language) was designed by a committee of American and European computer scientists during 1958-60 for publishing algorithms, as well as for doing computations. Like LISP (described in the next section), ALGOL had recursive subprograms-procedures that could invoke themselves to solve a problem by reducing it to a smaller problem of the same kind. ALGOL introduced block structure, in which a program is composed of blocks that might contain both data and instructions and have the same structure as an entire program. Block structure became a powerful tool for building large programs out of small components. <br />
			ALGOL contributed a notation for describing the structure of a programming language, Backus-Naur Form, which in some variation became the standard tool for stating the syntax (grammar) of programming languages. ALGOL was widely used in Europe, and for many years it remained the language in which computer algorithms were published. Many important languages, such as Pascal and Ada (both described later), are its descendants.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Lisp</h5>
		<p>LISP (list processing) was developed about 1960 by John McCarthy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and was founded on the mathematical theory of recursive functions (in which a function appears in its own definition). A LISP program is a function applied to data, rather than being a sequence of procedural steps as in FORTRAN and ALGOL. LISP uses a very simple notation in which operations and their operands are given in a parenthesized list. For example, (+ a (* b c)) stands for a + b*c. Although this appears awkward, the notation works well for computers. LISP also uses the list structure to represent data, and, because programs and data use the same structure, it is easy for a LISP program to operate on other programs as data. <br />
			LISP became a common language for artificial intelligence (AI) programming, partly owing to the confluence of LISP and AI work at MIT and partly because AI programs capable of "learning" could be written in LISP as self-modifying programs. LISP has evolved through numerous dialects, such as Scheme and Common LISP.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">C</h5>
		<p>The C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan at the AT and T Corporation for programming computer operating systems. Its capacity to structure data and programs through the composition of smaller units is comparable to that of ALGOL. It uses a compact notation and provides the programmer with the ability to operate with the addresses of data as well as with their values. This ability is important in systems programming, and C shares with assembly language the power to exploit all the features of a computer's internal architecture. C++, along with its descendant C++++, remains one of the most common languages.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Business-oriented languages</h3>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Cobol</h4>
		<p>COBOL (common business oriented language) has been heavily used by businesses since its inception in 1959. A committee of computer manufacturers and users and U.S. government organizations established CODASYL (Committee on Data Systems and Languages) to develop and oversee the language standard in order to ensure its portability across diverse systems. <br />
			COBOL uses an English-like notation-novel when introduced. Business computations organize and manipulate large quantities of data, and COBOL introduced the record data structure for such tasks. A record clusters heterogeneous data such as a name, ID number, age, and address into a single unit. This contrasts with scientific languages, in which homogeneous arrays of numbers are common. Records are an important example of "chunking" data into a single object, and they appear in nearly all modern languages.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Java</h3>
	<p>Java, modern object-oriented computer programming language. <br />
		Java was created at Sun Microsystems, Inc., where cofounder William (Bill) Joy led a team of researchers in an effort to create a new language that would allow consumer electronic devices to communicate with each other. Work on the language began in 1991, and before long the team's focus changed to a new niche, the World Wide Web. Java was first used on the Web in 1994, and Java's ability to provide interactivity and multimedia showed that it was particularly well suited for the Web. <br />
		The difference between the way Java and other programming languages worked was revolutionary. Code in other languages is first translated by a compiler into instructions for a specific type of computer. The Java compiler instead turns code into something called Bytecode, which is then interpreted by software called the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), or the Java virtual machine. The JRE acts as a virtual computer that interprets Bytecode and translates it for the host computer. Because of this, Java code can be written the same way for many platforms ("write once, run anywhere"), which helped lead to its popularity for use on the Internet, where many different types of computers may retrieve the same Web page. By the late 1990s, Java had brought multimedia to the Internet and started to grow beyond the Web, powering consumer devices (such as cellular telephones), retail and financial computers, and even the onboard computer of NASA's Mars exploration rovers. Because of this popularity, Sun created different varieties of Java for different purposes, including Java SE for home computers, Java ME for embedded devices, and Java EE for Internet servers and supercomputers.</p>
