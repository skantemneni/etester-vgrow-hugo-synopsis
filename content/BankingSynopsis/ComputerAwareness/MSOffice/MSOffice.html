	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction to MS - Word</h3>
	<p> Let us consider an office scene. Many letters are typed in the office. The officer dictates a letter. The typist first types or drafts a copy of the letter. The officer goes through it to check mistakes regarding spelling errors, missing words, etc. and suggests corrections. The typist changes the letter as suggested by the officer. This is a simple example of word processing. <br />
		There are many software packages to do the job of word processing. Some of them work in DOS environment. Examples are WordStar, Word Perfect and Professional Write. But in these days working in WINDOWS is becoming more and more popular. So let us consider software for word processing which works in WINDOWS. Our choice is MS-WORD because it is the most popular software in these days.<br />
		MS-WORD is a part of the bigger package called MS OFFICE, which can do much more than word processing. In fact when you open up MS OFFICE you will find four main components in it. They are MS-WORD (for word processing), MS EXCEL (for spreadsheet), MS ACCESS (for database management) and MS POWERPOINT (for presentation purposes). However, we will limit ourselves to MS-WORD only in this lesson. <br />

		<span class="highlight01">What is Word - Processing ?</span>
		<br />
		Word Processor is a Software package that enables you to create, edit, print and save documents for future retrieval and reference. Creating a document involves typing by using a keyboard and saving it. Editing a document involves correcting the spelling mistakes, if any, deleting or moving words sentences or paragraphs. <br />
		<span class="highlight01">(a) Advantahes of Word Processing</span>
		<br />
		One of the main advantages of a word processor over a conventional typewriter is that a word processor enables you to make changes to a document without retyping the entire document. <br />
		<span class="highlight01">(b) Advantahes of Word Processing</span>
		<br />
		Most Word Processor available today allows more than just creating and editing documents. They have wide range of other tools and functions, which are used in formatting the documents. The following are the main features of a Word Processor. </p>

		<p>We have already told you that for working in Ms-Word you should be familiar with WINDOWS. If you have not covered WINDOWS so far then read that first and then go through MS-WORD. By now you must be aware of the fact that a software package is improved from time to time. These improvements are sold in the market as new versions of the same software. Thus you will find many versions of MS-WORD being used in different offices. In this lesson we will cover the version MS-WORD 2003 and the latest version of MS word 2013. <br />
			While working in MS-WORD you have to work with a <span class="highlight01">mouse.</span> Also one can work, to some extent, through the keyboard. The use of mouse is simpler as it is fully menu driven. In MS-WORD every command is available in the form of 'icons'. <br />
			You can go inside MS-WORD by the following way.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Take the mouse pointer to START button <br />
						On the task bar. Click the left mouse button. The monitor will show like as follows: <br />
						Move the pointer to <span class="highlight01">programs.</span> You will notice another menu coming up to the right.
