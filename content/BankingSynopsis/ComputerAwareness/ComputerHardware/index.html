	<p> Computer today has become an important part of our lives. Infat today we are living in the age of Information Revolution which is much to be owed, to the ability of computers of disseminating information at an incredible speed.<br />
		From education to entertainment and from communication to business, computers are present every where. <br />
		Thus in this, era of Information, it is cruacial to have the basic knowledge of computer, its parts, its components and its application find way in a variety of fields.<br />
		A sound theoretical base of computer and its applications would enhance the knowledge level of the reader and would definitely make the journey in the colourful world of computers, an exhilarating one. </p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Generations of Computer: </h4>
		<p> The first four generations of computers were based on, vacuum tube technology; <br />
			the transistor and integrated circuit technology; and the very large scale integrated (VLSI) technology, respectively.</p>
		<p> The important feature of the fourth generation VLSI technology was the use of a microchip weighing a few grams.<br />
			A thin silicon chip using 0.13 micron technology has a memory capacity of one Gigabyte <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (10^9 \ bit)  \) </span>.<br />
			Today the development has entered the area of "artificial Intelligence." <br />
			These are generally called as fifth generation of computers.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">History of Computer</h3>
	<p> Actually speaking electronic data processing does not go back more than just half a century i.e. they are in existence Merely from early 1940's.<br />
		The very first modern electronic computer became operational only in early 1940's. Infact, it's only a little.<br />
		more than just five decades ago since the first modern electronic computer was brought into existence for the purpose of business data processing.<br />
		Computers before that were only used in scientific and technological field.</p>
	<p> Although the present modern electronic computers are very recent but the idea was conceived far back. The same could be seen by the advents of the history.<br />
		In early days when our ancestors used to reside in caves the counting was a problem. Still it was easier as he could count on his fingers but gradually it started becoming difficult.<br />
		As the belonging and possession increased, the need of more counting tools grew.<br />
		It was not possible to have more fingers. The record keeping switched to number of stones and then to scribbling on the walls of their caves.<br />
		But it was not possible to restrict oneself to stones and walls and they had to look out for some other counting devices.<br />
		As the civilization grew in mid-seventh century, the adding tools and devices, started developing across the world.<br />
		Thus we can say that idea of computing is as old as the civilization itself, It is very important to learn how people attempted to create early computers as they played very important role in reaching this stage.</p>
	<p> When they started using stones to count their animals or the possessions, they never knew that this will lead to a computer of today.<br />
		People started following a set of procedures to perform calculations with these stones, which later led to creation of a digital counting device, which was the predecessor of a computer.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">1450 B.C.-Abacus-China</h4>
		<p> The abacus is the first known calculating device. This illustrates how the ancient computers worked.<br />
			It was invented by the Chinese and is still widely used in the far east for commercial calculations.<br />
			In its primitive form, it consists of a wooden frame with a number of wires with beads strung through them.<br />
			The beads are used for counting and calculations. To Show a number, beads are pulled down so that each rod represents a digit.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">1450 A.D.-Napier Bones</h4>
		<p> Another counting device is Napier Bones. John Napier. a Scottish Mathematician, invented it. The "bones" were strips of ivory with numbers written in them.<br />
			When the bones were arranged properly, the user could read the numbers in adjacent columns to get the answer of a multiplication operation.<br />
			During the 16th to 19th centiries, Europeans contributed in calculating machine by inventing several machines that used existing technologies like clockwise gears and levers</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">1642 A.D.-Adding Machine-Blaise Pascal-France</h4>
		<p>The well known French Scientist and Mathematician, Blaise Pascal invented the first machine which could add, carry digits automatically.<br />
			He was only nineteen years old at that time. His machine was so revolutionary that the principle behind it is still used in most of the mechanical counters being used today.<br />
			He became great philosopher and mathematician of Europe. His father was a tax commissioner and he used to accompany his father to his office.<br />
			There he felt the need of some calculating device, Which could save people like his father from that boring and tedious job of doing sums over and again.<br />
			He came out with a machine "Pascaline" that worked with clockwise gears and levers.<br />
			The machine was basically developed to perform addition and substraction operations. The machine rotated wheels to register values and lever was used to perform the carrying operations from one wheel to another.<br />
			Although the machine was not accepted by the business but it initiated a series orinventions.<br />
			To give honour to Pascal, a computer programming language was named after him.<br />
			This language, Pascal, is generally used to teach programming to budding programers.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">1642 A.D.-Difference Engine-Charles Babbage - England</h4>
		<p> Since early 19th century, Charles Baggage, an Englishman, had been working on the development of a machine, which could perform complex calculations .<br />
			In 1813 A.D. he invented the 'Different Engine' which could perform complex calculations and print them out as well.<br />
			This machine was a steam-powered machine. While Babbage was working on his doctorate,<br />
			he had to solve many complex formulae and he found it difficult to cope up with them in the given time period </p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Early 1800'S Jacquard Loom- Joseph Marie Jacquard</h4>
		<p> In the early nineteenth century, a French weaver Joseph Marie Jacquard developed a programmable loom, which used large cards and holes punched in them to control the pattern automatically.<br />
			The output was a thick rich cloth with repetitive floral or geometric patterns.<br />
			Jacquard patterns are still produced to this day. Others adapted the punched cards and used as the primary form of input.<br />
			They were used till about 20-25 years ago.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">1862-"Arithrometer-Charles Xavier Thomas-France</h4>
		<p> This was the first calculator with commercial prospects. Frenchman Charles Xavier Thomas (known as Charles of Colmar) developed it.<br />
			He won a gold medal at the International Exhibition in London.<br />
			The machine performed addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root functions accurately</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">1863 A.D.-Analytic Engine-Charles Babbage-England</h4>
		<p> Babbage had been working on very elaborate machine all this time.<br />
			By 1863 he had all the plans ready for the machine which he named the Analytic Engine.<br />
			He had conceived of a mechanism, which could carry out long sequence of complex calculations under automatic control.<br />
			It would have the ability, to store 1000, 50-digit numbers in one second and multiply 20-digit numbers in three minutes.</p>
		<p> Babbage used a form of punched cards for inputting the data That would have been a complete modern computer but technology at that time was not advanced enough to provide him with the hardware he required.<br />
			He was thinking too far ahead of his time and his ideas could not be implemented.<br />
			However, he was the first person to conceive of the "Stored Program Concept".</p>
		<p> Babbage worked on his plans for years. He was accompanied by Augusta Ada Byron (the daughter of famous poet Lord Byron), a brilliant Mathematician whose contribution to Babbages work is tremendous.<br />
			She is the first female computer scientist and a programer. A computer programming language; Ada has also been named in her honour.</p>
		<p> Charles Babbage is recognized as "the father of Computers" Although his plans could not be materialized and his <br />
			analytical engine could not be completed in his life span but a working analytical engine was finally developed from his plans in year 1991 and is on the display at the Charles Babbage Institute at Minnesota.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">1930s-Turing Machinr-Alan Turing</h4>
		<p> In late 1930s the English Mathematician wrote a paper describing the capabilities and limitations of a hypothetical general purpose-computing machine "Turing Machine".<br />
			Turing also helped constructing Robinson, the British computer used during the World War II to decode German messages that were encrypted by the German Enigma machine. <br />
			In 1950, Turing published a book titled "Computer Machinery and Intelligence", in which he proposed the turing test of Artificial Intelligence.<br />
			That test is still used by scientists. Turing test basically explains that computer is capable of "interacting" with the user.</p>

<section class="skill" id="07">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Computer Generations</h3>
	<p> The term "generations" was initially introduced to distinguish between different hardware technologies.<br />
		Gradually it shifted to both hardware and software as the total systems consists of both of them.<br />
		The computers can be divided in five past generations, i.e., depending upon the technologies used. The five generations of computer are: </p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">1st Generation: </h4>
		<p> Until 1951, electronics computers were the exclusive possession of scientists and the military.<br />
			Till then nobody tried to use them for business purpose. The idea of marketing them was conceived by Mauchy and Eckert, creators of ENIAC's.<br />
			As US census bureau was already using IBCP cards, they were the pioneers in buying this computer for the first time in 1951.<br /> The company created by M and ETS became UNIVAC division of Sperry and Corporation.</p>
		<p>The bringing of first UNIVAC (Universal automatic computers) general purpose electric digital computer, marks the beginning of the first generation of electronic computers.</p>
		<p> These computers used valves and all the components were joined by copper wires.<br />
			Due to large size of the components and due to the facts that the components had to be spaced apart as the valves dissipated a lot of heat,<br />
			the computers were very bulky and required huge electric power, airconditioners, maintenance and space for their installation.<br />
			Further, the speed of operation was very slow and had a very low reliability factor as vacuum tubes failed frequently.<br />
			They were still given the name of "electronic brains" by the journalists.<br />
			They also said that these electronic brains will change the world one-day.<br />
			Later IBM corporation developed IBM 701, IBM 702 and 1B0 650 and few other systems.<br />
			These were called the First generation' computers. The popular brand of first generation computer was IBM 650, which had a magnetic drum memory and utilized punch cards for input and output.<br />
			Computer belonging to this generation had the following characteristics.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Comparatively large in size as compared to present day computers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Generated lot of heat, they were not consistent and reliable as the valves tended to fail frequently</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Low capacity internal storage.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Individual, non-related models.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Processors operated in the milliseconds speed range.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Internal storage consisted of magnetic drum and delay lines.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">2nd Generation: </h4>
		<p> FGC were very unreliable, mainly because of vacuum tubes which kept on burning out.<br />
			Users had to be prepared all the time with dozen of extra tubes to replace them.<br />
			The computers of this generation were characterized by the use of solid state devices (transistors) instead of vacuum tubes.<br /> Transistorized circuits were smaller, generated little heat, were less expensive and consumed less power than vacuum tube circuits and were much greater in processing capacity.<br />
			Since transistors had a faster switching action, this generation computers were significantly faster and smaller and were more reliable too than first generation computers.<br />
			The use of magnetic cores as the primary internal storage medium and the introduction of removable magnetic disc pack were other major developments of the second generation.</p>
		<p> Some of the popular Models in this generation lot computer systems, were IBM-1401, IBM- 1620, UNIVAC-1004.<br />
			Many of these computers were used for business applications.<br />
			Computers of this generation had the following characteristics: </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Smaller in size compared to the first generation computers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Generated a lower level of heat, as components were much smaller</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Greater degree of reliability because of solid state technology.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Higher capacity of internal storage.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Use of core storage instead of magnetic drum and delay lines.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">3rd Generation: </h4>
		<p> A revolution in the computer developments took place with the development of integrated circuits (IC) on a single silicon chip.<br />
			In 1958, Jack St. Clair Kelby and Robert Noyce invented the first IC.<br />
			IC incorporated number of transistors and electronic circuits on a single wafer or chip of silicon. IC is called chip because of the way they are made.<br />
			They are also called as semi conductors as combining layers of materials that have varying capacity to conduct electricity form them.<br />
			This ushered in the third generation of computer systems in 1964. The integrated circuits enhanced considerably the processing capability and the speed of the computer.<br />
			Some of the popular third generation computers are IBM-360, series, IBM-370 series and ICL-2900 series.</p>
		<p> Integrated circuits technology is responsible for bringing in revolution in the computer industries.<br />
			Scientists were aware that more powerful computers can be built by building more complex circuits, but as these circuits had to be wired by hand, these computers were too complex and expensive.<br />
			IC solved this problem by introducing a computer that costed lower than first generation computer and offered more memory and faster processing.<br />
			By 1967, IBM decided to change its track as number of programming language came in the market.</p>
		<p> This was the beginning of software industry as the language grew and people who had the skills to translate user requirements in these language were high on demand now.</p>
		<p> One more technology development which took place was the launching of first telecommunication satellite.<br />
			The communication stations on the earth were now in a position to send and receive data by means of satellite enabling communications between the computer systems around the world.<br />
			Computers of this generation have the following characteristics: </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Smaller in size as compared to second generation computers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>

				<li>
					<p>Remote communication facilities.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">4th Generation: </h4>
		<p>The 1970's marked the beginning a new generation of computers, the development of microprocessor chip, which contains an entire central processing (CPU) on a single silicon chip led to the mushroom growth inexpensive computers.<br />
			They are not computers by themselves but they can perform all the functions of arithmetic logic unit and control units of the CPU.<br />
			When these microprocessors are connected with memory and input-output devices, they become microcomputers.<br />
			The semiconductor memories are also very sr" a and very cheap.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="111105003_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>There are several types of memory chips. Three of the mos: commonly used are <br />
			(a) Random Access Memory (RAM) in which data can be read or written corresponding to the main memory of the conventional computer,<br />
			(b) Read Only Memory (ROM) and <br />
			(c) Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM).<br />
			In the ROM chips, the data are burnt into the chip at the manufacturing time. It cannot be changed.<br />
			These chips are usec in systems where the data need to be changed. Even when power supply fails, the data remains in the memory.<br />
			In case of PROM a user can program and even correct the data if necessary. The fourth generation of computer may be called microcomputer generation.<br />
			The input and output devices used with fourth generation are quite advanced.<br />
			The use of very large integrated circuits (VLIC) has made the fourth generation (micro) computers very compact, much less expensive, faster, more reliable and of much greater data processing capacity than equalized third generation computers.<br />
			Some computers belonging to fourth generation are DEC-10, STAR- 1000, PDP-11 and APPLE Series Personal Computers. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">5th Generation: </h4>
		<p> Till fourth generation of computers. the major stress was on improving the hardware from valves to transistors and then to integrated circuits,<br />
			which resulted in miniaturization and fast speed of computers.<br />
			However, the lack of thinking power has forced the scientists to work further for Fifth generation computers. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Characteristics of Computer</h3>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01"> Accuracy </span>
		<br />
		Computers are very accurate. They do make mistakes but seldom. This is because of their physical circuit.<br />
		Even if they make mistakes it  might be because of the faulty programs, some mistake made while feeding in the data or poorly designed system.<br />
		The highly efficient error detecting techniques of the computer from showing false results.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01"> Speed </span>
		<br />
		The computer was initially invented as a very high-speed calculator <br />
		This helped in completing Many scientific projects that were
		previously impossible. When talking about speed of the computer
		, we don't talk in seconds21k in seconds or microseconds but in nanosecond ( <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10^{-9}  \) </span> seconds)or even picoseconds (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10^{12}  \) </span> seconds).<br />
		You imagine the speed of computer by the fact that a computer can add two 18-digit number in 300 to 400 nanoseconds that means that  it can do about 3 million calculations per second</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Versatility </span>
		<br />
		This means that the computers are capable of performing any type of task, provided the activity could be put into logical steps:<br />
		It can be used from cooking (microwave oven) to spending a night on the moon (through satellites).<br />
		In today's world it is difficult to imagine even a single field which is untouched by computer invasion.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Stroage</span>
		<br />
		A human mind acquires some knowledge and after it has used, it might keep it in its subconscious mind or might even forget it after some time<br />
		But computers can store massive amounts of information. This information can be used and reused time and again for years (unless something goes wrong with the hardware).<br />
		Today's computers have the disks, which have the capacity of storing billions of characters<br />
		This is big enough to store the complete Britannica Thesaurus, dozens of computer programs or the applications, thousands of songs, huge databases, all the projects we have ever done in our life and much more.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Memory</span>
		<br />
		Sometimes if we try to recall what we studied last year, we are not able to recollect. In case of computer, it's not like that.<br />
		If we store any information in the computer's memory, it remains there till we delete it.<br />
		Moreover the memory of computer is unlimited, we can store as long as we want.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Automation</span>
		<br />
		A computer is much more than just a calculator in which we need to give the instructions at every step.<br />
		It is an intelligent device and if programmed for an activity, it keeps doing it till it finishes, without any human intervention</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Diligence</span>
		<br />
		Computer being a machine. does not show any signs of fatigue. tiredness, lack of concentration, or lost interest.<br />
		The speed, accuracy and the quality would be absolutely same in the first and the last calculation, even if millions of calculations are done by computer.<br />
		It will not complain even once that they are bored. Thus, it is best specially for monotonous and voluminous work.<br />
		Although that is a threat for the people who are working on the same kind of jobs.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Reliability</span>
		<br />
		Above all qualities of the computer make them reliable and also make us too dependent on them.<br />
		They can be run for year and years without any loss of data or any other problem.<br />
		Although it has got so many uses but the only limitation we could find is that they are not creative. They are designed and run by humans only.<br />
		They might make the exact copy of Picasos paintings but actually can not give the world their original creations, <br />
		they might print out numberless books of Shakes-peare's Hamlet but can never write anything on its own, they might replicate the Tajmahal, seventh wonder of the world but will never be able to give an architecture like that.<br />
		And we must be happy for that as we humans, still are superior to computers.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Central processing unit (CPU):  </h4>
		<p> The CPU is at the heart of all computers. All data pass through it. The CPU is the computing part of the computer. Also called the processor. <br />
			A complete computer system requires the addition of control units, input, output, and storage devices and an operating system" (CMP Net Online Encyclopedia ).<br />
			Micro-computers/personal computers commonly run at 2 gigahertz per second. Mainframe computers measure their speed in millions of instructions per second. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Random access memory (RAM):</h4>
		<p> RAM consists of microchips that allow for the temporary storage of data.<br />
			RAM functions as the work place for the CPU. It is common for a computer to have 500 megabytes of RAM.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Input devices:</h4>
		<p> Computers receive information from a variety of sources. The most common input devices are a keyboard along with a mouse.<br />
			Desktop or laptop computers are the center of a workplace, with input links from digital cameras, handheld computers, scanners, micro-phones, and voice commands.<br />
			Some devices, such as handheld computers, function as both input and output devices.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Output devices:</h4>
		<p> An important output device is the computer monitor, which is increasingly lighter in weight and flat because of new liquid crystal display units that also enable laptop computers, cell phones, and PDAs to have color screens.<br />
			It is also common for a screen on a cell phones or a PDA to be both an input and output device.</p>
		<p> Computer projectors are commonly used to display data or information onto a large screen for group viewing, training, or showing Web sites.<br />
			Many businesspeople travel with both a portable computer and a computer projector to visually display information for training or to aid in sales at remote sites </p>
		<p> The GUI and general popularity of computers have also promoted significant changes in the hardware options for printing.<br />
			The earliest printers were essentially automatic typewriters and had little flexibility.<br />
			Currently, there are a wide variety of printers (including inkjet and laser) available and capable of color and black and white. The output has improved to near-professional quality prints.<br />
			While many people have talked about paperless offices for decades, the popularity of printing devices and variety of papers attests to current uses.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Connection devices:</h4>
		<p>Because of the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, all desktop and laptop units contain built-in network interface capability.<br />
			Most newer laptops also come with the ability to use wireless communications.<br />
			The network interface normally uses an Ether-net protocol, and these devices offer both input and output capability.<br />
			Wireless technology allows users continual connectivity while out of the office.<br />
			This has revolutionized everything from allowing the police to immediately trace stolen vehicles to an on-site roofing salesperson checking stock on particular colors of roofing.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Multimedia:</h4>
		<p> Computers can reproduce both sound and video. Material can come from standard audio compact disks but increasingly more of it is from the Internet.<br />
			Users can also view and/or edit both still and digital pictures or video.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Storage Devices:</h4>
		<p> All computers use a hard drive to store programs and files. The size of an average hard drive is about 100 gigabytes.<br />
			That size would have been considered enormous as recently as 2000. Further, changes have made the floppy disk obsolete; new computers do not come with a floppy disk drive.<br />
			The newest storage device is the flash drive, which is smaller than a package of gum but can hold 1 gigabyte of storage.<br />
			The hardware allowing for flash drives is also used on such devices as Sony's Memory Stick and other units that are designed to be supple-mental storage <br />
			for PDAs, iPods, cameras, telephones, MP3 players, and other mobile devices.</p>
