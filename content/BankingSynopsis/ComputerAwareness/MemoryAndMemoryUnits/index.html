	<h3 class="skill-heading">Main Memory</h3>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Main Memory:</span>
		is the second major subsystem in a computer. It consists of a collection of storage locations, each with a unique identifier, called an <span class="highlight01">address.</span> Data is transferred to and from memory in groups of bits called <span class="highlight01">words.</span> A word can be a group of 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits or 64 bits (and growing). If the word is 8 bits, it is referred to as a <span class="highlight01">byte.</span> The term "byte" is so common in computer science that sometimes a 16-bit word is referred to as a 2-byte word or a 32-bit word is referred to as a 4-byte word.<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Address space</span>
		<br />
		To access a word in memory requires an identifier. Although programmers use a name to identify a word (or a collection of words), at the hardware level each word is identified by an address. The total number of uniquely identifiable locations in memory is called the <span class="highlight01">address space.</span> For example, a memory with 64 kilobytes and a word size of 1 byte has an address space that ranges from 0 to 65,535. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Example 1:</span>
		<br />
		A computer has 32 MB (Megabytes) of memory. How many bits are needed to address any single byte in memory? <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Solution</span>
		<br />
		The Memory address space is 32 MB, or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2^{25} (2^5 \times 2^{20})  \) </span> This means that we need <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   log_2 2^{25}, \) </span> or 25 bits, to address each byte. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Example 2:</span>
		<br />
		A computer has 128 MB of memory. Each word in this computer is eight bytes. How many bits are needed to address any single word in memory? <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Solution</span>
		<br />
		The memory has 128 MB, which means <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   2^{27}. \) </span> However, each word is right <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   2^3. \) </span> bytes, which means that we have <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   2^{24}  \) </span> words. The means that we need <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  log_2 2^{24},  \) </span> bits, to address each word. </p>

			<span class="highlight01">  Connecting CPU and memory </span>
			The CPU and memory are normally connected by three groups of connections, each called a <span class="highlight01">bus: </span> data bus, address bus and control bus. I/O devices cannot be connected directly to the buses that connect the CPU and memory, because the nature of I/O devices is different from the nature of CPU and memory. <br />
			I/O devices are electromechanical, magnetic, or optical devices, whereas the CPU and memory are electronic device I/O devices also operate at a much slower speed than the CPU/memory. There is a need for some sort ofintermediarytohandie this difference. Input/output devices are therefore attached to the buses through input/output controllers or interfaces. There is one specific controller for each input/output device.</p>
