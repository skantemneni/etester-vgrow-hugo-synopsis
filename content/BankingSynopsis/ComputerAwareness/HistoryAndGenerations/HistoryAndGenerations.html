<p> Each generation of computer is characterized by a major technological development that fundamentally changed the way computers operate, resulting in increasingly smaller, cheaper, more powerful and more efficient and reliable devices. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Generations Of Computers</h3>
	<p> The computer has experienced five generations, with the fifty generation still very much in development. </p>

		 </div>
		<p>This generation of computers was developed at the University of Manchester, England. It was described as a vacuum tube-based electronic computer.<br />
			The Univac 1 in 1951 was one of the earliest versions.</p>

		 </div>
		<p>The second generation of computers used solid state components to replace vacuum tubes.The reduction of cost and size was made possible by the development of transistors. They originated in the late 1950s.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Third Generation</h4>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="111105013_image-3.png" alt="image3" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>In this generation, integrated circuits replaced several individually wired transistors. This development provided computers thatwere smaller and more reliable. These originated in the early 1960s.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Fourth Generation</h4>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="111105013_image-4.png" alt="image4" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>This generation of computers is founded on microprocessors. A modern microchip Fourth generation computers have been made readily available to us because of the development of the microchip.<br />
			Large-scale integration technology allowed thousands of transistors to be constructed on one small slice of silicon material. This technology originated in the mid 1970s. The majority of computers you will come into contact with today are of this generation.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Fifth Generation</h4>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="111105013_image-5.png" alt="image5" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>This generation of computers represents a unification of four separate areas of research :</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Knowledge - based expert systems
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Very high - level propramming languages
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Decentralized computing
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Ultra large - scale integration technology (ULSI)
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p> Computers of this generation make use of parallel processing and they are capable of performing multiple, simultaneous instructions using more than one micro processing chip. </p>
