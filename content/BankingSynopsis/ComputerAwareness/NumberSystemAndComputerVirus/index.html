	<h3 class="skill-heading">Number System</h3>
	<p>The language we use to communicate with each other is comprised of words and characters. We understand numbers, characters and words. But this type of data is not suitable for computers. Computers only understand the numbers. <br />
		So, when we enter data, the data is converted into electronic pulse. Each pulse is identified as code and the code is converted into numeric format by ASCII. It gives each number, character and symbol a numeric value (number) that a computer understands. So to understand the language of computers, one must be familiar with the number systems. <br />
		The Number Systems used in computers are:

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Binary number system</h4>
		<p>It has only two digits '0' and '1' so its base is 2. Accordingly, In this number system, there are only two types of electronic pulses; absence of electronic pulse which represents '0'and presence of electronic pulse which represents '1'. Each digit is called a bit. A group of four bits (1101) is called a nibble and group of eight bits (11001010) is called a byte. The position of each digit in a binary number represents a specific power of the base (2) of the number system.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Decimal number system</h4>
		<p>This number system has ten digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) so its base is 10. In this number system, the maximum value of a digit is 9 and the minimum value of a digit is 0. The position of each digit in decimal number represents a specific power of the base (10) of the number system. This number system is widely used in our day to day life. It can represent any numeric value.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Hexadecimal number system</h4>
		<p>This number system has 16 digits that ranges from 0 to 9 and A to F. So, its base is 16. The A to F alphabets represent 10 to 15 decimal numbers. The position of each digit in a hexadecimal number represents a specific power of base (16) of the number system. As there are only sixteen digits, four bits (24 = 16) of binary number system can convert any hexadecimal number into binary number. It is also known as alphanumeric number system as it uses both numeric digits and alphabets.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Internet</h4>
		<p>Internet is a global network that connects millions of computers across the world. It uses standard internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to connect billions of computer users worldwide. It is set up by using electronic, wireless and networking technologies. It is the fastest mean of sending or exchanging information and data between computers across the world. <br />
			It is believed that the internet was developed by "Defense Advanced Projects Agency" (DARPA) department of United States. And, it was first connected in 1969. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Website</h4>
		<p> Website is a collection of related web pages that may contain text, images, audio and video. The first page of a website is called home page. Each website has specific internet address (URL) that you need to enter in your browser to access a website. <br />
			Website is hosted on one or more servers and can be accessed by visiting its homepage using a computer network. A website is managed by its owner that can be an individual, company or an organization. </p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="111105012_image-4.png" alt="image4" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p> A website can be of two types: </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p> Static Website </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Dynamic Website </p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Static website</h5>
		<p> Static website is the basic type of website that is easy to create. You don't need web programming and database design to create a static website. Its web pages are coded in HTML. The codes are fixed for each page so the information contained in the page does not change and it looks like a printed page. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Dynamic website</h5>
		<p>Dynamic website is a collection of dynamic web pages whose content changes dynamically. It accesses content from a database or Content Management System (CMS). Therefore, when you alter or update the content of the database, the content of the website is also altered or updated.<br />
			Dynamic website uses client-side scripting or server-side scripting, or both to generate dynamic content. <br />
			Client side scripting generates content at the client computer on the basis of user input. The web browser downloads the web page from the server and processes the code within the page to render information to the user. <br />
			In server side scripting, the software runs on the server and processing is completed in the server then plain pages are sent to the user. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Computer Virus</h3>
	<p> Computer viruses are unwanted software programs or piece of codes that interfere with the functioning of computer. They spread through contaminated files, data and insecure networks. Once it enters your system it can replicate to produce copies of itself. These copies of virus enable it to spreads from one program to other program of computer and from one infected computer to other computer. </p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Types of Computer Virus</h4>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p> Overwrite Virus </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Macro Virus </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Boot Virus </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Resident Virus </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Multipartite Virus </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> File Infector Virus </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Computer Worm </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Trojan Horse </p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Overwrite Virus</h5>
		<p> Overwrite virus is the simplest computer virus. It overwrites the code of infected file with its own malicious code. The content of infected file is replaced partially or completely but the size of file does not change. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Macro Virus</h5>
		<p> Macro virus alters or infects the macros of a document or data file. It is embedded as macro in a document and adds its codes to the macros of the document. The virus spreads when infected documents or data files are opened in other computers.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Boot Virus</h5>
		<p> Boot virus or boot sector virus alters the boot sector program stored in hard disk or any other storage device. It replaces the boot sector program with its own malicious version. Usually it enters into your system through corrupt media files, infected storage devices and insecure computer networks. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Resident Virus</h5>
		<p> Resident virus stays permanently in the primary memory (RAM) of computer. When you start the computer it becomes active and corrupts the files and programs running on the computer. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Multipartite Virus</h5>
		<p> Multipartite virus spreads and infects in multiple ways. It infects both the files as well as the boot sector.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">File Infector Virus</h5>
		<p> It is one of the commonly found computer viruses. It particularly infects the executable files; the files with .com or .exe extensions. The virus becomes active when the infected file is executed. The active virus overwrites the file partially or completely. Thus it may destroy the original file partially or completely. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Computer Worm</h5>
		<p> Computer worm is similar to virus but is technically different from virus. It can replicate and spread like virus but unlike viruses it don't need a host program to spread. Being able to self replicate it can produce multiple copies of itself. It spreads through networks such as an email sent to an infected email id can infect your system with computer worm. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Trojan Horse</h5>
		<p> Trojan horse is a malware like a virus or worm but it is technically different from both. It can't replicate like virus and worm. Trojan horse hides itself in a program. Once you install any such program the trojan horse enters into your computer. It can provide unauthorized access to your computer, send your files to other computers and may delete files or can make other unwanted changes in your computer. </p>
