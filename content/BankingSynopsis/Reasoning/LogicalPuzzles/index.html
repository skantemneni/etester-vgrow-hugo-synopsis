		It refers the information which is implied or inferred from a statement, that means the information is never clearly stated. <br />
		Inference means a fact that can truly be inferred from the contents of a given statement. Here, candidates are required to approach the questions from a logical angle. In this section of logical reasoning, the question consists one or two statements followed by certain inferences based on it.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Types of Questions </h3>
	<p>Logical reasoning may be categorised in two types.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Type 1 </h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Statement and Conclusion</h5>
		<p>A conclusion means a fact that can be truly inferred from the context of a given statement or the passage. Hence, a conclusion is the brief or point of view that is supported or defended with the premises.<br />
			In these types of questions, a statement or a set of statements followed by some inferences is given. Candidates are required to analyse the given statement and understand their indirect implications and decide which of the given conclusions logically follows from the given statements.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Type 2 </h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Statement and Assumption </h5>
		<p>An assumption is the hidden part of an argument and something supposed or taken for grant.<br />
			In these types of questions, a statement is followed by two or more assumptions. Candidates are required to access the given statement and decide which of the given assumption implicit directly in the statement. </p>

		<p>While solving the question asked from this chapter, we should keep these important points in our mind. </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>The presence of words like although, inspite of, because of and despite of favours a valid conclusion.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>A conclusion can be valid which is directly related with context to the given statement.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>A conclusion can be valid if seems with positive action context to the given statement.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> A conclusion can be valid if seems easy to derived from the given statement.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>A conclusion cannot be valid which consists any of hard condition, such as Only, Best, Definitely, Certainly, Strongest and All.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> The relation between statement and conclusion, as directly related conclusion can easily be derived from the statement.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>A conclusion with positive action is always valid.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>A conclusion with negative action is never valid.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Sometimes assumptions are contrary to their statement or not connected with the statement and can easily be rejected.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>An assumption is invalid if it is a mere restatement putting it it different words of given statement.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The given assumption is invalid if it is an inferrence derivable from given statement.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>An assumption is invalid if it uses farfetched reasoning.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Statement is a part of our speech of which most of the ideas rema unexpressed.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Assumption is something in which the readers assume on the basis of the given statement.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If statement and assumption are not co-related then it is not implicit validity.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Assumption is always positive regarding the complition of the work favouring the executor.</p>
