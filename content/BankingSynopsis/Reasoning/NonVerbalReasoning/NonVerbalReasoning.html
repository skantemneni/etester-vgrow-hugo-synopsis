	<h3 class="skill-heading">Non Verbal Reasoning</h3>
	<p>Non-verbal reasoning tests consist of those tests in which figures, digits, letters and symbols are used. The instruction or direction given before the questions need careful understanding. In these tests, your power of logical reasoning, speed of thinking and the ability to differentiate or find co-relations between given objects/figures/patterns will be tested. Non-verÂ¬bal tests make use of diagrams, figures or designs to evaluate your mental ability, speed of reasoning and differeniation etc., rather than academic knowledge. Most non-verbal reasoning tests can be classified under the following categories.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Series</h4>
		<p>This chapter deals with the problems based upon the continuation of figures. There are various types of problems on series. However, the fundamental concept for each type is the same. There is a sequence of figures depicting a change step by step. Either one of these figures is out of order and has to be omitted or figure has to be selected from a separate set of figures which would continue the series. <br />
			There are two directions mostly used in the figures. </p>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Five Figure Series</h5>
		<p>This type of problems on series consist of five figures numbered. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 forming the problem set, followed by four other figures A, B, C, and D forming the Answer set. The five consecutive problem figures form a definite sequence and it is required to choose one of the figures from the Answer set which will continue the same sequence.<br />

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Analogy</h4>
		<p>Ana1ogy literally means 'similarity' or corresponding figure/image i.e.(having similar features or character.) This segment of non-verbal reasoning has been designed to test the ability of a candidate to understand the relationship between two figures, which follow a certain rule, and apply the same rule to select the figure which establishes the same relationship with the figures asked in the question.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Type.1 </span>
			<br />
			In these type of questions, two sets of figures namely problem figures and answer figures are given. The set of problem figures consists of two parts. The first part comprises two figures which have same relationship between them on the basis of certain rule. The second part comprises one figure and a sign of question mark (?) Students are asked to select one figure from the set of answer figures which replaces the sign of question mark (?) in such a way that it bears same relationship with the other figure as first figure of the first part bears with second figure of the same part, following examples illustrate the typed and methods to solve the questions on analogy. </p>
