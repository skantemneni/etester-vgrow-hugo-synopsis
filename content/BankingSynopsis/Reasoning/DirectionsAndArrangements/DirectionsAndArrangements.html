	<p> The direction of right turn always clockwise and that of left turn is anticlockwise. Thus, </p>

	<p> In order to determine the distance travelled or the shortest straight distance between the two given points, the Pythagoras formula <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  h^2 = b^2 + p^2  \) </span> proves to be helpful. <br />
		Here, h = Hypotenuse <br />
		p = perpendicular <br />
		b = Base </p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 1:</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> Question:</span>
			<br />
			Alok walked 30 metres towards east and took a right turn and walked 40 metres. He again took right turn and walked 50 metres. Towards which direction is he from his, starting point ?</p>

		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="111102006_image-4.png" alt="image4" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p> It is clear from the diagram that Alok is in South-West direction from his starting point. </p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> Question:</span>
			<br />
			A and B standing at a distance of 20 km. from each other on a straight East-West road. A and B start walking simultaneously, eastwards and westwards respectively, and both cover a distance of 5 km. Then A turns to his left and walks 10 km. 'B' turns to his right and walks 10 km. at the same speed. Then both turn to their left and cover a distance of 5 km. at the same speed. What will be the distance between them?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			It is mentioned in the question that A starts walk-ing eastwards and B west-wards. Therefore, A is at west end. </p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="111102006_image-5.png" alt="image5" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
