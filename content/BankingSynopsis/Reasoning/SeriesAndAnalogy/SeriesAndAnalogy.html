	<h3 class="skill-heading" id="01">Series and Analogy</h3>
	<p> A series or sequence consists of several terms. In other words, the units of a sequence are called TERMS.<br />
		Each term in the series has its own importance as there exists certain relationship between the two consecutive terms. <br />
		All the terms in the sequence follow a certain pattern throughout the se-quence in most cases. We come across several types of questions based on any given series. <br />
		In order to solve such questions you must recognise the pattern of the given series. <br />
		The questions based on English alphabet series are somewhat easy as you can remember the position of each alphabet readily. <br />
		But in the case of mixed series or jumbled series, it is very difficult to remember the position of each term. </p>
	<p> A mixed series comprises letters. numbers and symbols and unlike the English alphabet series the number of terms is not fixed in such series.<br />
		A mixed series may contain any number of terms viz. 23, 24, 26, 28. 30, 31 or 32.<br />
		Such questions require sufficient practice as there is no definite SHORT CUTS for these questions. The questions on mixed series can be divided into two major heads :</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>Series of letters and numbers, and </li>
			<li> Series of letters, numbers and symbols. </li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p> Questions on mixed series tend to judge how quickly you can identify the relationship amongst the given terms (letters, numbers and symbols). Such questions can be solved quickly by counting the terms very fast.</p>
	<span class="highlight01">Some Important Tips</span>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<li>First of all, count the terms in the given series.</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Pin point the middle term, if any. </li>
			<li>Write down the total number of letters, numbers and symbols respectively.</li>
			<li>Form the groups of five terms, counting from either end so that you can recognise the position of the required term quickly. </li>

	<h3 class="skill-heading" id="02">Analogy</h3>
	<p> Usually two to three questions asked in Bank P.O. Examination from Verbal Analogy in addition to questions on Non-Verbal Analogy.<br />
		Analogy is an important section of Reasoning because it is that section through which examiners test the candidate's ability to compare and establish proper relationship among the given items on the basis of certain commonality.<br />
		In case of question on Non-Verbal Analogy, it is very easy to recognise the
		common features between the given figures owing to certain limitations. <br />
		Figures may have similar movement, rotation, orientation, shape, size, etc. and if you are able to observe these features you can select appropriate answer quickly. <br />
		But in case of question on Verbal Analogy it is not possible to delimit types of relationship which exist between the given items. <br />
		Apart from common types of relationships, sometimes unusual type of relationship is provided in the questions. <br />
		Therefore, the chapter on Analogy is aimed not only at testing your reasoning ability but also overall knowledge, IQ, as well as the power of decision making.</p>
	<p> Questions on Analogy cover almost all types of relationship or commonality that one can think of and which we generally observe in our day to day life </p>
