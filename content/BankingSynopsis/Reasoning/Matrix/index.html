	<p>In this type of queuions. either a <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2 \times 2  \) </span> or a <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2 \times 2  \) </span> matrix is formed by a group of figures These figures form sets - either row-wise or columnwise and each of these sets follows the same rule. The candidate is required to analyse each the sets to find out the common rule and then on its basis, the missing figure is to be idenyified from a set of alternative, so as to complete the matrix.</p>

		</p>
		<p>Clearly in the upper-row the number of dots in the second ?gure is thrice the number of dots in the ?rst ?gure. Similarly, in the lower-row, the number of dots in the second figure must be thrice the number of dots in the first figure. So, the number of dots in the missing ?gure must be 2 x 3 = 6. Hence, ?g. (d) is the answer.</p>

		</p>
		<p> : Clearly, in each row, the second ?gure is obtained by rotating the ?rst?zure through <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  135^{ \circ}  \) </span> ACW and the third ?gure is obtained by rotating the second ?gure through <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  135^{ \circ}  \) </span> ACW. Hence, ?g. (d) is the answer.</p>
