	<h3 class="skill-heading" id="01">Bar Charts</h3>
	<p> The bar chart, in comparison to the pie chart is more versatile in representing data. It has been proven that representation using lengths as in the case of bar charts is a better indicator of data vis-a-vis pie charts where in data is categorized in terms of areas.</p>

	<p>In the above diagram, the same data has been represented length-wise in the bar chart and area-wise in the pies chart.<br />
		Obviously, it is easier to see the contribution of the various segments in the bar chart than in the pie chart.</p>
	<p>A therefore, is a chart with rectangular bars of lengths proportional to the values which they represent. Usually,the terms 'bar chart' a. 'bar graph' are used interchangeably. It should also be noted that in a bar chart, what matters is the length of the bar and	not the width of the bar.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Significance of Bar Charts </h4>
		<p>Following are the major specialities of bar charts: <br />
			Unlike the pie chart, a single bar charts can be used to compare two, or more than two continuous variables.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> Example</span>
			<br />
			The following bar chart represents the number of seats won by different parties in two general elections: </p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="111102004_image-2.png" alt="image2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>Since the length parameter is easier to study than the area parameter, a bar chart gives a quick understanding at the various ranks. Hence the time taken to understand the data becomes comiderably lower in a bar chart as compared to otherformats of data presentation.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Type of Bar Charts </h4>
		<p> There are three types of bar charts: </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Normal Bar Charts </h5>
		<p>This is a simple bar chart with the values of different segments <br />
			represented in the form of bars, which could be either horizontal, vertical or both.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			The following bar chart represents the crime cases reported in delhi in 2007:</p>
		<span class="highlight01">Bar Chart with Vertical Bars</span>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="111102004_image-3.png" alt="image3" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />

		<span class="highlight01">Bar Chart with Horizontal Bars</span>
		<div class="synopsis-image">

		 </div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Stacked Bar Chart Value-wise </h5>
		<p> When the same variable is to be represented on more than one parameters like; year etc., then we can have a stacked bar chart.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Stacked Bar Chart Percentage-wise </h5>
		<p> The only difference between value-wise and percentage-wise bar charts is that in the former we apply values to stack the bars and the later we apply percentages.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Stacked Bar Charts are also known as Cumulative Bar Charts.</span>

		 </div>
		<p>Following things can be observed in the above stacked bar chart : </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>The total number of murders have been added up in one bar and the difference years are shown as a part of that total </li>
				<li>The same data could also have been re presented by taking the sum of all the crimes reported in a particular years as a total, and the individual crimes as a part of that total.</li>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Pie Charts</h3>
	<p>Pie charts are a typical type of data representation where data is represented as a part of a circle.<br />
		The circle represents the total value (or 100%), and the different parts represent certain proportions (or percentage) of the total.<br />
		In a pie chart, the arc length of each, the arc length of each sector (and) in turns its central angle and area), is proportional to the part it represents.</p>
	<p>There are two approaches to constructing a pie chart from any given data : </p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>Degree Approach: <br />
				The central angle in a circle represents <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  360^{ \circ}  \) </span>. , so any part or segment in a pie chart is calculated as a proportion of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  360^{ \circ}  \) </span>.</li>
			<li>Percentage Approach: <br />
				In this case, any part or segment in pie chart is calculated as part of 100%.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
	</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="111102004_image-7.png" alt="image7" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>If we convert the same pie chart into the degree format, we will he required to do thefollowing conversions:<br />
		Total = 100% = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  360^{ \circ}  \) </span>
		<br />
		Hence 1% = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3.6^{ \circ}  \) </span>
		<br />
		Central = 10% = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  36^{ \circ}  \) </span>
		<br />
		North = 20% = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  72^{ \circ}  \) </span>
		<br />
		South = 25% = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  90^{ \circ}  \) </span>
		<br />
		East = 15% = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  54^{ \circ}  \) </span>
		<br />
		West = 30% = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  108^{ \circ}  \) </span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Limitations of Pie Charts </h4>
		<p> Despite the pie chart being one of the most important ways to represent data, it is marred by limitations of its own: <br />
			Pie charts can he used only when the sum of all categories is given, for example if the categories represent proportions or percentage of a total.<br />
			A single pie chart can represent only one continuous variable.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Significance of Pie Charts </h4>
		<p>The pie chart has gained prominence due to the following reasons:<br />
			In a pie chart, we get a clear picture of the contribution of different sectors. the build up of the total. E.g., presentation of budgets.<br />
			Comparingtwo pie charts is easier than comparing two bar charts or any other format of data representation.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Question</span>
			<br />
			What is the percentage increase in the sales value of the East zone, ?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution</span>
			<br />
			There are two percentage increases (A) The total sales value of company XYZ is increasing. (B) The percentage contribution of the East zone is increasing.<br />
			Percentage increase in the total sales value of the company XYZ = 30% <br />
			Percentage increase in the percentage contribution of the East zone = 20%
			Hence, the net percentage increase = 56% </p>
