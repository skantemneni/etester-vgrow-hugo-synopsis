	<p> A CODE is 'a system of signals'. Coding is, therefore, a method of transmitting a message between the sender and the receiver which thrid person cannot understand or comprehend. <br />
		The coded message can be deciphered or decoded by the receiver as he/she knows the rule/method which was empolyed in encoding the message. <br />
		Thus, the CODING-DECODING test is given to judge the candidate's ability to decipher the rule which is applied for coding a particular message and break the code to reveal the message. <br />
		In this type of questions some words or a group of letters and their coded forms are provided and you are required to find out the rule of coding so that you can either encode or decode another word or another group of letters in similar fashion. <br />
		Any word/message/a group of letters can be coded in a variety of ways. <br />
		Generally, each question is based on a particular rue of coding. <br />
		Therefore, cules of a particular question are not applicable to the other questions. <br />
		The coding pattern may be based on individual alphabet/words and digits/numbers. The code of a particular letter could be following or preceding letter, the letters of a meaningful word can be jumbled to generate code and so on.</p>

		<p> This type of letter coding are based on alphabets or word. which is given on some pattern which is look like a code and candidate need to analyze the pattern and give the answer according that. </p>
		<p> In Letter coding type question you need to analyze the given coding pattern according that obtain the answer. First you have to observe the both letter code then notice the position of letters and search the common pattern.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Number Coding </h5>
		<p> This type of Number coding are based on Numbers or Numerical digit. which is given on some pattern which is look like a code and candidate need to analyze the pattern and give the answer according that.</p>
		<p> In number coding type question you need to analyze the given coding pattern according that obtain the answer. First you have to observe the both Number code then notice the position of Number and search the common pattern. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Number to letter coding type </h5>
		<p> In number to letter coding Type has given some group of numbers according with some group of letters are assign. you have to understand the pattern and analyses of that and evaluate the answer with comparing the number with letters groups. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Substitution coding </h5>
		<p> In substitution questions some things are identify with there term or names which has given or written with code you need to find and answered according with there pattern of language.</p>
