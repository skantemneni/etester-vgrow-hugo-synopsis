	<p>Data Interpretation is the act of transforming data with the objective of extracting useful information and facilitating conclusions on the basis of the given data. Depending upon the type of data and the questions, we might be required to apply certain statistical tools with various methods to represent the given data.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Data</h4>
		<p>Data is a means to represent facts, concepts or instructions in a formalized manner suitable for communication, interpretation or processing by humans or other automatic modes. <br />
			In other words, propositions like measurements or observations of a variable, which may comprise numbers, words or images can be quantified with the help of data. <br />
			Data can be a numerical or non-numerical fact and figure related to a particular social, economic or political event etc. <br />

			In the last general elections in India, 40% of the total seats were won by regional parties. Data can be further understood to be an agent to cause the sentiments and even sometimes it can be effect also. <br />
			If the data given is distinct and separate, i.e. It can be counted (1, 2, 3, ....), then it is known as Discrete Data, For example, population of country, production of cars in a manufacturing plant. <br />
			However, if the data takes any value within a finite or infinite interval, then it is known as a Continuous Variable. For example, the percentage of sugar in mangoes or weight/height etc., are continuous variables.</p>
