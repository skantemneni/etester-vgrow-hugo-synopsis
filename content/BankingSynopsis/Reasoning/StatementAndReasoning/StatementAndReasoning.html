			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>The argument should not be just an opinion.It must answer one of the questions - Why, How, When, What - of the statement. Otherwise it is not an argument.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>An argument also depends on the language used because by changing a few words we can make a weak argument forceful.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The argument must be judged as an argument and not with what somebody or newspapers say (s).</p>

						<span class="highlight01">Statement:</span>
						<br />
						Should we follow non alignment as foreign policy ?<br />
						<span class="highlight01">Argument:</span>
						<br />
						The argument is not forceful. If somebody says in favour of any policy or adopts it, that does not mean that it is a correct policy<br />
						<span class="highlight01">Explanation:</span>
						<br />
						Yes, because Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru advocated it. <br />
						If some one is quoted in support of the statement it cannot be a forceful argument.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Statement:</span>
						<br />
						Is child the faher of man?<br />
						<span class="highlight01">Argument:</span>
						<br />
						Yes, because Words-worth has saia, 'Heaven lies about us in our infancy.'<br />
						<span class="highlight01">Explanation:</span>
						<br />
						The argument cannot be forceful only because someone has quoted in support of the statement.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Statement:</span>
						<br />
						Should admission to all professional courses be made on the basis of past academic performances rather than through entrance tests?<br />
						<span class="highlight01">Argument:</span>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>Yes. It will be beneficial for those candidates who are unable to bear the expenses of entrance tests.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Yes. Many deserving candidates securing high marks in their qualifying academic examinations do not perform well on such entrance tests.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>No. The standard of examinations and assessment conducted by different boards and universities are not comparable and hence there is a need to conduct entrance tests to calibrate them on a common yardstick. <br />
									Decide which of the argu-ments is/are 'strong' argument(s) and which is/are 'weak' argument(s).</p>
							</li>

								<p>Only III is strong</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>All I, II and III are strong </p>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<span class="highlight01">Explanation:</span>
						<br />
						The scheme to select deserving candidates cannot be abolished just because of the expenditure it entails. There fore, argument I is not strong. Also, students who are intelligent enough to secure good marks in academic examinations have no reason not to perform well in entrance tests. Therefore, argument II also does not hold. Argument III seems to be strong.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Statement and Assumptions</h3>
	<p>An <span class="highlight01"> assumption </span> is something that can be supposed by the implied meanings of the given statement. <span class="highlight01"> Imply </span> means 'to suggest or express indirectly.' Often people do not speak what is in their mind or what they think in totality, but we can  infer or assume what must have in their mind from the statemens made by them. For example when you say, 'An honest Police Inspector has come to the city, and so will be checked', then the assumption you make is that if Police Inspector is honest, he could put a check on the crime. Thus, when we say something we do not express everything, every aspect of our ides into words. We tend to leave many things or ideas unsaid, which may be defined as an <span class="highlight01"> assumption </span>. It is that part of an argument on the basis of which we say something. Now, we can say that an <span class="highlight01">assumption</span> is that part of an argurment, which is not expressed or said explicitly as it is assumed or understood intrinsically. Consider the following illustration :</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Statement:</span>
					<br />
					Robert is a good player of Indian hockey team. So, India should win the match. <br />
					When we analyse these statements, we can express the same idea more elaborately as:
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>Robert is a good player of dian hockey team</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>A good player is likely to h his team win the match.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>So, India may win the match.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					The statement (ii) is left unsaid deliberately while arguing because it is taken for granted. Hence, it is assumption. Thus, an assumption is the hidden part of an argument. <br />
					In short, we can say that an <span class="highlight01">assumption</span> is something which is assumed, supposed or taken for granted. <br />
					Assumption is one type of implication. If we ask a person."Did you go from Delhi to Patna by air?".we assume that Delhi and Patna are connected by air (route) - it is the implied meaning of the statement.Therefore, an implication may be an assumption, i.e., on the basisnof which we say some thing. Consider another example: <br />
					<span class="highlight01">Ex.Statement: </span> Our country has stood like a solid rock on the face of common danger. <br />
					from the statemen it is implied that there have been dangers to our country-this is also an assumption. Here it shouldbe noted that implications can also be <span class="highlight01">long drawn conclusions </span> and such conclusions are not valid assumptions. Note that there is basic difference between the assumption and implication. An <span class="highlight01">assumption </span> is something <span class="highlight01">on which the statement is based </span>. On the other hand, an <span class="highlight01">implication </span> is somthing which is derived from and, therefore, <span class="highlight01">based upon the statement,</span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Statement:</span>
					<br />
					Democracy in the sence of majority rule is not what people are seeking. The middle classes in the ukraine, Bosnta, Thailand and Venezuela are demanding greater accountability, and which form obstacles to a better future. <br />
					Which of the following <span class="highlight01">assumption </span> is implicit in the above statement? <br />
					(An assumption is something supposed or taken for granted) .

					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>The middle classeswaant a goverment that is accountable, responsible and effective in moving their country further into the modern world.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The importance of middle classes has been enhanced in the governance of a democratic country.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>the middle classes are capable of overthrowing a corrupt goverment.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Democracy, in true sense, does not mean the rule of majority which takes into consideration only the numbers.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Except a small number of countries in the world, other countries do not favour democratic from of goverment.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<span class="highlight01">Explanation:</span>
					<br />
					The middle classes are now not merely passive consumers or docile voters, they are demanding that governments not accustomed to accountability and showing deference to popular demands, start acting like true democracies. So, Option (I) may be an assumption.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Statement:</span>
					<br />
					Read the following information carefully and answer the given question: <br />
					'Pets are not allowed in the park premises'- A notice put up at the park entrance by the authority that is responsible for maintenance of the park.Which of the following can be <span class="highlight01">an assumption </span> according to the given information?(An assumption is something that is supposed or taken for granted) <br />
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>At least some people who visit the park have pets.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>This is the only park which does not allow pets</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>People who ignored this notice were fined</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>There are more than one entrances to the park</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Many people have now stopped visiting the park</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<span class="highlight01">Explanation:</span>
					<br />
					Obviously option (I) is an assumption.
