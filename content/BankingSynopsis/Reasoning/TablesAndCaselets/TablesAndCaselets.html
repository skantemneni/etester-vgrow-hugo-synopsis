	<h3 class="skill-heading">Pictorial</h3>
	<p> This is the most common form of data representation. In such problems, data is presented in various pictorial forms such as tables, line graphs, bar diagrams, line charts etc. <br />
		The important point to remember pertaining to all these questions is the fact that each and every question asked in the CAT is based on some logic and reasoning meant to check your aptitude. Few questions that involve numbers may also require a basic level of calculation skills.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Table</h3>
	<p>Tabular method is the most fundamental way of representing data. In fact, most of the different kinds of data presentation formats like the bar charts, line charts etc. originate from the table.

		</table> 
	<p>The tabular format is considered to be the most versatile data presentation method. All data which can be expressed in any other format can also be expressed in the format of a table. On the other hand, it is quite possible that data that can be presented in a tabular format, cannot be presented in any other format like the pie chat etc.</p>
