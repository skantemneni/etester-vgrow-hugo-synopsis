	<h3 class="skill-heading">Machine Input</h3>
	<p> In this chapter you are asked to identify the process done by a machine. These process done by a machine. These process are performed repeatedly as per a pre-fixed pattern and subsequently we have different output in different steps. Let's take simple example to understand it. <br />
		Computer would be the best example, in computer when we give any input, then it processes it and finally we get output. Similarly in Machine input, there is input, then there are certain step to simplify it and final step is termed as 'output' <br />
		There are two types of questions in this </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Shifting Type:</h4>
		<p> In shifting question are based on a particular pattern on interchanging position of elements. And the machine doesn't stop here but goes on performing its operation. <br />
			In this type of question, we usually shift the given words / numbers, of the given input as per a fixed pattern. <br />
			Ex - for shifting </p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Arrangement Type:</h4>
		<p>In this type of questions, the words or the numbers are arranged as per a fixed pattern. This pattern can be an alphabetical order in case of words, it can be an increasing or decreasing order in case of numbers. <br />
			How to identify whether the given input is if shifting or arrangement? <br />
			The basic difference between them are that the shifting goes on endlessly and at last it is written and so on and in arrangement arranging ends as soon as the order intended is achieved i.e., arangement type of question has last step. <br />
			Arrangements is of two types.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>

						Single - side - arrangement

						Double - side - arrangement

						In question on shifting "can't be determined" is almost never the correct answer.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						After some practice you should develop the ability to solve questions without needing a pen.

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Before anything else, make sure that the input - output question is about shifting.

		</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						In question on arrangement when any step is given and input is asked answer will be "cant be determined".
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						To identify the pattern in question prefer the last step </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						In this type of question when words all of sudden get transformed in number then the numbers most of the time comes from the place value of frist or last letter of the word.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						In arrangement problems, the contents of an earlier step can never be determined with certainly.
