	<h3 class="skill-heading">Data Sufficiency</h3>
	<p> A typical <span class="highlight01"> Data Sufficiency </span> question contains a problem followed by two statements numbered
		I and II (sometimes three) containing certain data or information which may be required for solving the given problem. <br />
		You are required to determine whether the problem can be solved with the help of the data provided in the first statement and/or the second statement.<br />
		Thus. questions on Data Sufficiency are meant to judge the candidates' ability to determine the information necessary to solve a given question (rather than actual solution of the same). <br />
		Therefore, it is the test of skill.</p>
	<p> The candidates must be able to determine the 'minimum' information required for solving the question so that you may arrive at the most appropriate answer choice. <br />
		Apart from the information given in the question and the statements, nothing should be taken for granted. <br />
		You are not to assume anything ,beyond the information given in the question and the following statements.</p>
	<p> Questions on Data Sufficiency may be asked from any topics of the
		General Intelligence or Critical Reasoning such as Ranking/Arrangement, Coding-Decoding, Blood Relationship, Age Problems, Distance and. Direction Test, Mathematical problems and so on. <br />
		However, these questions are asked in a different format and as such, somewhat different approach is required to solve the questions on Data Sufficiency.<br />
		Now consider the following example :<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Direction (1 -2) :</span>
		<br />
		Each of the questions below consists of a question and three statements numbered I, II and III given below it, you have to decide whether the data provided in the statement are sufficient to answer the question. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Example1:</span>
		<br />
		Who amongst P, Q, R, S, T and V, each securing different marks, secured the second lowest marks ? </p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>R and T secured more marks than P and Q </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>V secured the highest marks</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>S secured more marks than P but less than Q </p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<span class="highlight01"> Explanations </span>
	<br />
	<p> From statement I <br />
		R, T &gt; P, Q <br />
		From statement II <br />
		V &gt; R, T, P, Q, S <br />
		From statements I and II <br />
		V &gt; R, T &gt; Q &gt; S &gt; P <br />
		Clearly, S secured the second lowest marks.</p>
