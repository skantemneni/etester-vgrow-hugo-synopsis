	<h3 class="skill-heading">Word Formation and Logical Order of Words</h3>
	<p>Word formation is advanced level alphabet test. This test is meant to test the ability of the candidate in word building process. In word formation. a main word is given and we have to choose that word, which can or cannot be formed from the main word. Sometime. a set of English letters are given in a jumbled order, and the candidates are asked to arrange them in a meaningful order. In some situations we are asked to choose particular letters from a word and arrange them to form a meaningful word.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Different Questions of Word Formation Type </h4>
		<p>In this chapter, we will deal with two types of questions :</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Word Formation Using Letters from a Given Word </h5>
		<p>In this type, three sub-types of questions gre asked. <br />
						First, a word has been given, followed by four other words, one of which can or cannot be formed by using the main word. <br />
						Second, a word has been given and candidates are asked to make new meaningful words using letters like <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1^{st}, \ 3^{rd}, \ 5^{th}, \ 8^{th}  \) </span>, etc, of the given word. <br />
						Third, a word has been given and candidates are asked to form as many meaningful English words as possible from the given word, using each letter only once in each word. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Direction </span>
			<br />
						In each of the following questions, a word has been given. followed by four other words, one of which cannot be formed using the letters of the given word. Find that word.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Ex.1 </span>
			<br />
						CONSTRUCTION </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>SUCTION</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>COINS</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>CAUTION</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>NOTION</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<span class="highlight01"> Sol </span>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> CAUTION </span> - All the letters except 'A' are present in the main word. Hence, <span class="highlight01"> 'CAUTION' </span>letters cannot be formed from the of the given word "CONSTRUCTION" </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Logical Order of Words</h4>
		<p>As the name-implies, in this type of problems, a sequence is formed with a certain number of words given in such a way that a particular arrangement of the words gives a logical step-by-step completion of the process or the activity described. With two examples we elaborate the working of this type of problems: <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Ex.1 </span>
			<br />
					Arrange the following words in a logical and meaningful order. </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Travel</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Destination</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Payment</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Berth/Seat number</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Reservation</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Availability of berth/seat for reservation</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="list1-ol default-spaced-indented list-numbered-style-lower-alpha">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>6, 2, 5, 4, 3, 1</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>5, 3, 4, 1, 6, 2</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>2, 6, 3, 5, 4, 1</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>1, 2,.5, 4, 3, 6</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<span class="highlight01"> Sol:(c) </span>
		<p> From the above words, it is clear that in order to perform a journey, from the above words, it is deduced destination is to be identified, secondly availability of berth seat is ascertained, followed payment for reservation. As a result, berth is allotted and travelling is completed.</p>
