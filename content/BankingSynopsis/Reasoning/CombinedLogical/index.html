		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Logical problems and solutions with reasoning and math </h4>
		<p> If we are talking about Logical problem questions in math and reasoning. These two subjects are very important according to the subject importance and scores. These have importance in daily life calculations and practical situations. Since there are some typical way to solve all these problems, but if we take regular practice and learning of formulas then we can solve easily all type of question and save your valuable time in bank exam. Because there are the different type of questions in math and reasoning, and all these types have some specific type of formula for every condition. You have to just understand the tricks and formulas for logical reasoning for banks</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> What are logical problems? </h4>
		<p> As a name is there that contain "logical" and "problem". Where logical means that have some specific logic behind them and have a logical way to solve these within some logical order. So, logical problem with the answer is a concern. Here problem means some reasonable situation, used to solve by some logical statements, in which we have to find the correct solution for a suitable situation. <br />
			In reasoning, all the topics are logical, because in reasoning every question is reasonable and solutions are more logical. We have to apply all our mind strength in question to solve all questions. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> What is logical problem solving? and how can we improve logical problems with the use of it?</h4>
		<p> Logical problem solving is the use of words and expressions to logically form mathematical symbols to solve questions. This process of solving the logical problem was developed by Richard Wallen. When we are talking about problem-solving, there are some steps that are essential for any problem solving: </p>

				<li>
					<p> What problems are presenting themselves?</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Do we know about the problem, gather information about a problem. </p>
				</li>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> What is logical reasoning problem?</h4>
		<p> Logical reasoning problem is not directly related only to reasoning but also math. Logical reasoning problem-solving questions asked contain both of question of math and reasoning. Logical reasoning problems asked in all competitive exam and placements tests, or entrance exam. In this section, we are providing logical reasoning problem and solving for bank exam. <br />
			Logical reasoning problem asked in objective form, they need to be identified what information relevant to an issue or argument and what impact further evidence. <br />
			Logical reasoning questions for bank exams check the ability to analyze, critically evaluate, and complete argument as they occur in ordinary language. The questions are based on short argument drawn from a variety of sources. The inquiries are intended to evaluate an extensive variety of aptitudes included in deduction fundamentally, with an accentuation on attitudes that are integral to the sensible thinking.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> How to improve logical reasoning problem and use of problem solving?</h4>
		<p>For this we have to follow: </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p> Recognize all the part of the argument and their relationship.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Recognizing the similarities and differences between patterns of reasoning. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Draw well-supported conclusions reasoning by analogy. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Recognizing misunderstanding or point of disagreements.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Determine how more evidence affects an argument.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The detecting assumption made by arguments.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Identifying or applying principle or rules</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Identifying explanation.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Logical thinking and problem-solving</h4>
		<p> Read each question carefully. Make sure that you understand the meaning of each part of the question. Make sure that you understand the meaning of each choice  and the ways in which it may or may not relate to the question posed. Do not pick a response simple, because it is true. Answer each question on the basis of the information that is given, even if you do not agree with it.</p>
