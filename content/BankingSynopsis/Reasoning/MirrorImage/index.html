	<p>The figure obtained by putting a mirror in front of the real figure is known as mirror image. The reflection of object into the mirror is called its mirror image. It is obtained by inverting an object laterally. If we combine the original figure and mirror image together they form a symmetry. Now look at these figures:</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="111102024_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>If we combine both the figures, we get a new figure in shape of the heart.</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="111102024_image-2.png" alt="image2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>Take a mirror and place it along the vertical dotted line running through the middle of this shape. You will see that the half figure on the left together with its image in the mirror gives the complete figure of the heart. So, this heart-shape is said to have a reflection symmetry and the reflection takes place along the vertical line of symmetry at the middle. <br />

			<br />
						Here are certai questions in which the the hour - hand and he positions o f  the minute - hand of clock as seen in a mirror are given. On the basis of the time indicated by the mirror image of the clock we have to detect the actual time in i ons the clock, In the solution of such quest  we have the fact that if an object A is the mirror - image of another object B then B is the mirror Image of A. The method of solving such questions would be clear from the following questions. <br />

						Looking into a mirror, the clock shows 9 : 30 as the time. The actual time is<br />
