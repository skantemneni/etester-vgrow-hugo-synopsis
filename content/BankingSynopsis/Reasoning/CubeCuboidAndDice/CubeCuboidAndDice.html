				<p>How many small cubes will be there Total no. of cubes = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (X)^3 = (4)^3 = 64 \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>How many small cubes will have three faces painted?</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>From the figure it is clear that the small cube having three faces coloured are situated at the corners of the big cube because at these corners only three faces of the big cube meet. Therefore the required number of such cubes is always 8, because there are 8 corners.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>How many small cubes will have only two faces painted? From the figure it is clear that to each edge of the big cube 4 small cubes are connected and two out of them are situated at the corners of the big cube which have all three faces painted. <br />
								Thus, to edge two small cubes are left which have two faces painted. As the total no. of edges in a cube are 12. Hence the no. of small cubes with two faces coloured <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = 12 \times 2 = 24  \) </span>
					<br />
								(or) No. of small cubes with two faces coloured = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   (X - 2) \times  \) </span> No. of edges where X = (side of big cube / side of small cube)</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>How many small cubes will have only one face painted? <br />
								The cubes which are painted on one face only are the cubes at the centre of each face of the big cube. <br />
								Since there are 6 faces in the big cube and each of the face of big cube there will be four small cubes.</p>

			<li>
				<p>How many small cubes will have no faces painted? <br />

			<li>
				<p>How many small cubes will have only two faces painted in black and green and all other faces unpainted? <br />
								There are 4 small cubes in layer II and 4 small cubes in layer III which have two faces painted green and black. <br />
								Required no. of such small cubes = 4 + 4 = 8.</p>

				<p>How many small cubes will have only black painted? <br />
								No. of small cubes having only black paint. There will be 8 small cubes which have only black paint. Four cubes will be form one side and 4 from the opposite side.</p>

				<p>How many small cubes will be only red painted? <br />

				<p>How many small cubes will have at one face painted? <br />

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Rule No.1:</h5>
		<p>Two opposite faces cannot be adjacent to one another. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Ex :</span>
			<br />
				Two different positions of a dice are shown below. Which number will appear on the face opposite to the face with number 4?</p>

			<br />
				Faces with four numbers 6, 2, 5 and 3 are adjacent of to the face with No. 4. Hence the faces with no. 6, 2, 5 and 3 cannot be opposite to the face with no. 4. Therefore the remaining face with no.1 will be the opposite of the face with no. 4. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Rule No.2:</h5>
		<p>If two different positions of a dice are shown and one of the two common faces is in the same position then of the remaining faces will be opposite to each other.<br />

			<br />
				Here in both shown positions two faces 5 and 3 are common. <br />
				The remaining faces are 2 and 4. Hence the number on the face opposite to the face with number 2 is 4.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Rule No.3:</h5>
		<p>If in two different positions of dice, the position of a common face be the same, then each of the opposite faces of the remaining faces will be in the same position.<br />

				Therefore, opposite of 5 is 6 and opposite of 4 is 2.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Rule No.4:</h5>
		<p>If in two different positions of a dice, the position of the common face be not the same, then opposite face of the common face will be that which is not shown on any face in these two positions. Besides, the opposite faces of the remaining faces will not be the same.<br />

		<p>Here in two positions of a dice the face with number 1 is not in the same position. If The face with number 6 is not shown. <br />
				Hence the face opposite to the faCe With Besides the opposite face of 3 will be the number 1 is 6. <br />
				face with number 2 and opposite face to face 5 will be the face with number 1. </p>
