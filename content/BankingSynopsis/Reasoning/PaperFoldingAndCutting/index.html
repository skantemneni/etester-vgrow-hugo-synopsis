	<h3 class="skill-heading">Paper Folding and Cutting</h3>
	<p>In this chapter we will have to select a figure which would be the closest to the pattern that would be formed when a transparent sheet carrying designs on either side of a dotted line, is folded along the line. Here, a figure is obtained by folding a piece of paper containing same design along the dotted line. The resultant figure is to be selected out of a set of four figures given as alternative (A), (B), (C) and (D).<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Direction </span>
		<br />
					In each of the following problems, a square transparent sheet with a pattern is given. Figure out from amongst the four alternatives as to how the pattern would appear when the transparent sheet is folded at the dotted line. <br />

		<br />
					Transparent sheet </p>

					The right half of the transparent sheet is folded along dotted line and placed on the left half of the sheet. The figure thus obtained resembles the answer figure(D).</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Paper Cutting</h4>
		<p>In the questions based on paper cutting few figures are given showing the way in which a piece of paper is to be folded and then cut from a particular section. <br />
						The dotted line is the reference line along which the paper is to be folded and the arrow indicates the direction of the fold. Thus, these two figures indicate the sequence in which the paper is to be folded. The designs from the cut will appear on each one of the folds made on the paper. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Direction </span>
			<br />
						In each of the following questions, a set of three figures (X), (Y) and (Z) have been given, showing a sequence in which paper is folded and finally cut from a particular section. Below these figures a set of answer figures marked (A), (B), (C) and (D) showing the design which the paper actually acquires when it is unfolded are also given. You need to select the answer figure which is closest to the unfolded piece of paper.<br />

					In figure X upper part of triangle is holded with respect to dotted line towards lower part. In figure Y left part of the triangle is folded to the right about dotted line and finally right part of the triangle is folded towards left side about dotted line finally a circle has been cut.</p>
