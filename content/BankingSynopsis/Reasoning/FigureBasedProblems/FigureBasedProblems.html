		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Embedded Figures</h4>
		<p>A figure is said to be embedded in, suppose, if figure (X) contains a part of that figure. In this chapter, we deal with questions in which an original figure is given which in turn is followed by four alternative answers. One of the answer figures, is embedded or hidden in the original figure. You are required to select from the alternatives that figure which clearly shows the embedded portion in the original figure,:"</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Grouping of Identical Figures</h4>
		<p>In this chapter, we have a set of few figures which are numbered as 1, 2, 3, 4, ... We are required to analyse these figures and classify them into groups consisting of figures having more or less than same properties. The best answer is to be selected from a given set of fairly close alternatives. <br />

These matrix are formed by a group of figures. Corresponding rows or columns follow a certain pattern. You are required to analyse each of the sets to find out the common pattern and then on the basis of that the missing figure is to be identified from a set of alternatives, so as to complete the matrix.<br />

			Clearly, in the upper row, the number of dots in the second figure is twice the number of dots in the first figure. Similarly, in the lower row, the number of dots in the second figure must be twice the number of dots in the lower first figure. <br />
