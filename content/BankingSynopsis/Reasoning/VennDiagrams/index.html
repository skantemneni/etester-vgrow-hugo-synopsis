	<p>The best method of solving the problems based on inference or reduction is Venn diagram. <br />
		Venn diagram is a way representing sets pictorially. <br />
		Various cases of Venn diagram <br />
		<span class="highlight01">Case I :</span>
		<br />
		An object is called a subset of another object, if former is a p of latter and such relation is shown by two concentric cimles. </p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Pencil, Stationary</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Brinjal, Vegetable</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p> It is very clear from the above relationship that  object is a part of other, and hence all such relationship can be represented by figure shown. </p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="111102010_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Case II :</span>
		<br />
		An objects have an intersection with another objects share something  </p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Surgeon, Males</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Politicians, Indian</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Educated, Unemployed</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="111102010_image-2.png" alt="image2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>All the three relationships given above have something in common as some surgeons can be male some female, some politicians may be Indian and some belong to other countries, educated may be employed and unerripbyed as well And all the three relationships can be represented by figure shown.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Case III :</span>
		<br />
		Two objects are said to be disjoint when neither one is subset of another nor they share anything in common. M other word, totally unrelated object fall under this type of rehtionship. </p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Furniture, Car</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Copy, Cloth</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Toll, Shirt</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="111102010_image-3.png" alt="image3" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p> It is clear from the above relationship that both the object are mrelated to each other, and hence cm be represented .agrammatic ally as shown In figure above. <br />
		From the above discussion we observe.. representation of relationship of two objects is not typical if students follow the above points.  But representation of three objects diagrammtical pose stilt problem before students.<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Example:</span>
		<br />
		result of a survey of 1000 persons with respect to their knowledge of Hindi (H), English (E.) and Sanskrit (S) is given below. </p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="111102010_image-4.png" alt="image4" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p> What is the ratio of these who know all the three languages to those who do not known Sanskrit?</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{9}  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{10}  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{10}{17}  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{9}{27} \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Sol:</span>
		<br />
		The persons who know all the three	language are represented by the region which is common to all the three circles. <br />
		So, number such persons = 100 <br />
		The persons who do not know Sanskrit are represented by the region outside circle S. <br />
		So, number of such persons = (200 + 120 + 220) = 540. <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Required raatio = 100 : 540 = 5 : 27 </p>
