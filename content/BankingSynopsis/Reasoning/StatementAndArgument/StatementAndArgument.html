			In making decisions about important questions, it is desirable to be able to distinguish between 'strong' arguments and 'weak' arguments. 'Strong' arguments are those which are both important and directly related to the question. 'Weak' arguments are those which are of minor importance and also may not be directly related to the question or may be related to a trivial aspect of the question. <br />
			Each question below is followed by three arguments numbered (1), (2) and (3). You have to decide which of the arguments is a'strong'argument and which is a'weak'argument. <br />
