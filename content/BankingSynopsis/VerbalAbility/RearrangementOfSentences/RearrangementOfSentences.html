		<h4 class="skill-subheading">What does TENSE mean?</h4>
		<p> One of the most interesting but difficult units of objective test in English is sentence arrangement. In this test a candidate is required to arrange parts of sentence or sentences into a meaningful sentence or a paragraph. This requires a command over the structure of sentences along with a sound knowledge of grammar. This art can be gradually mastered by reading good books, newspapers and constant practice. You must read books very carefully giving full attention to the structures of the sentences. Gradually you will begin to feel that there are internal rules that bind a sentence because a loose sentence 6. expresses the main thought near the beginning adds explanatory material as it progresses and compiles a complete thought or an idea as it ends. <br />

		<p> This type of question may be solved by  Subject - Verb - Object - Qualifiers Location. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Note: </span>
			<br />
			A word or phrase that precedes an  adjective or adverb, increases or  decreases the quality signified by theword it modifies. <br />
			Here are the most common qualifiers in English (though some of these words have other functions as well: very, quite, rather, somewhat, more, most, less, least, too, so, just, enough, indeed, still, almost, fairly, really, pretty, even, a bit, a little, a (whole) lot, a good deal, a great deal, kind of, sort of. <br />
			Let us look at the above example:  </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Lakhs of students - (subject)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						From all over India — (qualifier of the subject (Q)
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Appear in the examination — (verb)
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Which are held - (qualifier of the verb)
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						On an all India basis - (qualifier of which are held)
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						By different organizations — (the last part) Thus the sequence is ACEDBF What is a qualifier?

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Method</h4>
		<p> The same method of arranging the paragraph first at the level of idea and then at the level of sentences should be followed 1. First, find some clues. For instance ,in this paragraph, we may find a clue in the reference to the time. The paragraph is about Miss Shital and Shilpa Kirti. The first thing that happened in relation to time was the fact that Shilpa lost her sight before she was three years old. Miss Shital arrived when Shilpa was seven.The other incidents took place later. Thus it is logical that the first sentence should be 'D' - the sentence telling us that Shilpa lost her sight before she was three years old. After that we can, arrange other sentences according tothe time sequence. So, the sequence is "D A E F C B" </p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Important Clues:-</h4>
		<p> In any paragraph there would be: </p>

				<li>
					<p>
						A central theme around which the passage is framed. Identify the central theme, which is usually the first sentence.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						A logical sequence is present whict, usually describes the central theme.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Sentences that begin with 'And', 'Bur etc usually follow the central theme with an explanation to the same or give additional information.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Tips for Beginners</h4>
		<p> Focus on improving your reading skills. Also try to improve your cognitive ability, For example — Go to a random website article. Go immediately to the second paragraph and after reading it try to guess what the author could have possibly said in the previous paragraph and the next paragraph. This will help you with a couple of other types of questions as well . </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Transition words:</h4>
		<p> Transition words make the shift from one idea to another very smoothly. They organize and connect the sentences logically. Observing the transition words found in a sentence can often give you a clue about the sentence that will come before/after that particular sentence. Given below are some commonly used transition words: also, again, as well as, besides, furthermore, in addition, likewise, moreover, similarly, consequently, hence, otherwise, subsequently, therefore, thus, as a rule, generally, for instance, for example, for one thing, above all, aside from, barring, besides, in other words, in short, instead, likewise, on one hand, on the other hand, rather, similarly, yet, but, however, Oil, nevertheless, first of all, to begin With at the same time, for now, for the time being, in time, later on, meanwhile, next, then, soon, the meantime, later, white' earlier, simultaneously, afterward, in conculsion, with this in mind, after all, all in all, to sum up <br />

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The idea is to destroy the enemy's productive capacity, and depending upon the economic foundation, that productive capacity is different in each case.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>

			<br />
			Look at the transition word "but" in the first sentence. It signifies that the sentence is expressing an idea contrary to an idea expressed in some previous sentence. Now we need to find that previous sentence. If we further look at the beginning of the first sentence, it says "but in the industrial era..." which suggests that the contrariness is with respect to eras. Looking further, we see that sentence B and C are also starting with statement about eras. But the transition word at the start of C is "now" which expresses present era and hence it cannot chronologically come before any other past era. That is, if information era is the present era, talk about any other era will come before this. So sentence B is the correct sentence to come before the first sentence. Likewise, sentence C is the correct sentence to come after the first sentence (sentence C is continuing the idea). Therefore, we have the link BAC. Furthermore, all the three options have the link EBAC. Therefore, we only need to arrange D and F. The sentence F states that "The purpose is...to battle with the enemy" and D questions "how do you battle with the enemy?" Therefore, D will come after F. <br />
			Hence FDEBAC is the correct arrangement. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Note:</span> The flow of author's ideas should be completely logical. The author does not jump from one idea to another suddenly.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Personal Pronouns:</h4>
		<p> Personal pronouns are he, she, it, him, her, they, you, your etc. Remember that personal pronouns always refer to a person, place or thing etc. Therefore, if a sentence contains a personal pronoun without mentioning the person, place or object it is referring to, the person, place or object must have come in the previous sentence. Often, this is a good lead to identify a link. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Demonstartive Pronouns:</h4>
		<p> The demonstrative pronouns are "this," "that," "these," and "those." "This" and "that" are used to refer to singular nouns or noun phrases and "these" and "those" are used to refer to plural nouns and noun phrases. Whenever a sentence contains a demonstrative pronoun without mentioning the noun or the noun phrase, it means that the previous sentence must be mentioning that noun or noun phrase. Finding that noun or noun phrase helps us connect two sentences.</p>
