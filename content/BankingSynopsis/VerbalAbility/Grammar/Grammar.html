	<h3 class="skill-heading">Common Errors</h3>
	<p> Five to ten questions are asked on common grammatical or idiomatic errors.<br />
		To answer the questions on common errors, a candidate must have a good command over the grammatical rules.</p>
	<p> In the question generally a sentence which is divided into four parts is given.<br />
		A candidate is to find out the part which contains the error. The error may be due to the defective use of a word or the use of a word which should not be made or missing of a word which must be used to make the sense clear.</p>
	<p>To spot the part which contains an error may be a difficult task.<br />
		For example, a sentence can be made correct by making change in one part or more than one parts.<br />
		But in objective type questions, a question should not have more than one answer.<br />
		So, a candidate has to find out the part by changing which the sentence can be made correct.</p>
	<p>In case of a general student, to develop a command over all grammatical rules is not a easy nut to crack.<br />
		Specially to a candidate who has completed his graduation grammatical rules are long forgotten.</p>
	<p>If a candidate likes to follow the commonly known grammars one must be choosy.<br />
		Generally a grammar contains a host of information.<br /> Classification, elaboration and other critical aspects are given much importance and a part of which may be proved fruitful.<br />
		The following topics are gaining more importance </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Sentence Improvement</h3>
	<p> Sentence Improvement or Phrase Replacement is basically related to Common Errors, or it may be taken as an improved version of questions on Spotting the Errors. <br />
		The only difference between the two types of questions is that in case of questions relating to Common Errors<br />
		A candidate has to spot the error only but in case of questions relating to Sentence Improvement one has to find out the correct alternative for the erroneous part.<br />
		The questions in this section may be related to Grammatical Norms, Word Usage, Idioms/ Phrases, Subject-Verb Agreement, Tenses, Gerunds, Prepositions etc.<br />
		General questions are framed on accepted rules of Grammar and Usage. But most of the questions are asked on exceptional rules.<br />
		Earlier, the questions of simple nature pertaining to the use of Articles, Prepositions, Common rules of Tenses etc.<br />
		were asked but now the emphasis has been shifted to Auxiliaries, Infinitives, Gerunds, Subject-Verb Agreement, Uses of Idioms/Phrases, Uncommon Structure etc.<br />
		which may pose some problems for general candidates. Errors, thus, may be in Grammar, Appropriate word usage or Idioms.<br />
		There may be a necessary word missing or there may be a word which should be deleted.</p>
	<p> In order to solve questions on Sentence Improvement correctly one must be acquainted with the rules of English Grammar and Usage, viz.,<br />
		Article, Noun, Pronoun, Adjective, Verb, Adverb, Voice, Mood, Preposition, Conjunction, Syntax, Tense, Infinitives, Gerund, Participle etc.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01"> Examples </span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01"> Directions (1 - 4) : </span>
		<br />
		In each question, a sentence with two word/groups of words printed in bold type are given.<br />
		One of them or both may have certain error. You have to find out the correct word or group of words from among the three choices A, B or C given below each setence which can replace the wrong word/group of words.<br />
		if any, and make the sentence grammatically correct. If the sentence is correct as it is,mark (5) i.e. 'No Correction. Required' as your answer.</p>
