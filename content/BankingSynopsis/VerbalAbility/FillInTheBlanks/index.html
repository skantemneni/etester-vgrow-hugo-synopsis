	<h3 class="skill-heading">Fill in the blanks</h3>
	<p> Fill in the blanks is a type of question or phrase with one or more types of words replaced with a blank line, giving the reader a chance to add the missing word (s).

			<li>
				<p>
					First read the sentence to yourself so you can hear what is being asked . Listen carefully to the way the sentence sounds each time and choose the option that sounds best in the sentence.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Try to quickly skim the text.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Look for the clues in the sentence :- It's not just the words directly before and after a blank that can provide clues.  Reading the entire sentence should help you figure out the general topic or subject area.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Make sure your choice fits logically and and grammatically
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Try to figure out the part of speech: <br />
					The answers to the majority of fill in the blank questions will be verbs or nouns.  An effective strategy for fill in the blank	questions is to try to determine which part of speech the missing word is.	<br />
					If an article ("a," "an," or "the") appears directly before the blank, the missing word is almost certainly a noun. The article "an" will also give you an additional clue because "an" indicates that the missing word starts with a vowel sound. If a blank is preceded by a noun or a pronoun, it often indicates a verb. Adverbs like "usually," "quickly," and "immediately" that appear before or after a blank also indicate that the missing word is a verb. Focus on the words/terms given in the options.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Look at the context around the gap and try to predict the word or type of word that could logically fill each gap before you look at the word options.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Reject options that you know are not appropriate in terms of meaning or the grammatical context.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Read each sentence to yourself several times, adding in each of the remaining possible options one-by-one. This will help you activate your knowledge of collocation.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Check the words on either side of each blank.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					If the sentence is of two blanks, then check the part of speech in the first option, if it doesn't match, that means that option should be rejected and vice-versa
				</p>
