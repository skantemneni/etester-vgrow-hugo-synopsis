	<h3 class="skill-heading">Verbal Reasoning</h3>
	<p>A paragraph is split into 6-8 sentences which are jumbled.<br />
		Such questions are designed to test a candidates's ability to analyse and evaluate the relationship among the split sentences and to arrange them in a logical and harmonious order.<br />
		A paragraph is a number of sentences grouped together and relating to one topic or a group of related sentences that develop a single point.<br />
		The first and most important principle of it is unity. The topic, theme or subject of a paragraph is very often, expressed in the first sentence.<br />
		It is called the key-sentence. The second principle is order that is, logical sequence of thought or development of the subject.<br />
		Events are related in the order of their occurrence and all ideas are connected with the leading idea and arranged according to their importance or order.<br />
		It should be noted that the first sentence states the topic - a fact, a statement or a proposition, the last sums up the whole paragraph.<br />
		Always keep these things in mind while solving questions on this topic.<br />
		Try to understand the logical sequence of thought. The arrangement will be easy. </p>
