	<p> There are two ways to report what a person says : </p>

					Direct speech and
				</p>

				<p>

			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p> In Direct speech, we use the exact words that someone says with the use of quotation marks. In Indirect speech, we report what someone says without using their exact words. We don't use quotation marks with indirect speech. but we have to change the pronouns and the tense of the verb. </p>
	<section>
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Direct Speech </h4>
		<br />
		<p> Direct Speech Direct speech is a sentence that repeats or quotes the exact words spoken by someone. When we use direct speech, we use quotation marks to enclose the words spoken without changing any of them. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Examples :</span>
			He said to me, "Be carefull" This is the Direct Speech. We merely repeat the exact words used by the speaker and keep the exact words within quotation marks. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Examples :</span>
			Quoting exactly what someone said: He said, "I'm going to hunt a tiger." </p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Indirect or Reported Speech </h4>
		<br />
		<p> Indirect or Reported Speech Indirect speech refers to repeating what another person says. When we report what someone says, we do not repeat exactly every word that was said. We normally change the tense of the words spoken as what has been said is already in the past. We also make changes to pronouns and other changes where necessary. Quotation marks are not used. <br />
			By using our own words to repeat what the speaker said:<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Examples :</span>
			He said to me, "Stop singing the same old song!" (Direct speech) <br />
			He told me to stop singing the same old song. (Indirect speech). <br />
			This is the Indirect or Reported Speech. <br />
			We use the past tense when the main verb used by the speaker is in the past tense. <br />
			Here, we do not use th quotation marks. <br />
			Instead, we use an infinitive (to stop) and we repeat the pronouns (He). <br />
