	<h3 class="skill-heading">Cloze Test</h3>
	<p> A doze test (also doze deletion test) is an exercise, test, or assessment consisting of a portion of text with certain words removed (doze text), where the candidate is asked to replace the missing words. The Cloze test measures the students' comprehension abilities by giving them a short text, with blanks where some of the words should be filled. This version of the test resembles the directions to a computer game, describing the game's rules. This task requires students to build an internal representation of the text, to put the words together in a meaningful way, so that they will be able to interpolate (guess, based on the given information) what words belong to the blanks. <br />
		Cloze tests require the ability to understand context and vocabulary in order to identify the correct words or type of words that belong to the fill in the blanks of the passages of a text. </p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Where did the cloze testing method originated?</h4>
		<p> It came from Gestaltist Principle of the Law of Closure. People tend to fill in missing pieces to form a complete picture. However, it is back formation from closure to cloze, not cloze method though. The exercise of cloze test was first described by W.L. Taylor in 1953. <br />
			Words may be deleted from the text  in question either mechanically or selectively, depending on exactly what aspect it is intended to test for. The methodology is the subject of an extensive academic literature. <br />
			Vocabulary based cloze tests are common in all the examinations. They usually require you to choose the correct choice out of five possibilities.</p>

		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Read the text through trying to understand the general meaning.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Look at each missing word gap and try to imagine what the correct word should be.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Decide which part of speech (adjective, noun, gerund, etc.) needs to be used to fill in each gap.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Read the text again, trying to fill gap as you come to it by imagining what the correct answer should be.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Read the text another time, this time choose the correct answer from the five(sometimes four) answers given.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If you are unsure of any given answer, try reading the sentence with each of the five possibilities.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Try to eliminate two of the obvious false answers (usually two relatively false answers are given) When stuck etween two answers, go with the one that sounds right.
					</p>
				</li>

		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Do not stop to answer questions on your first reading or just at the blank.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Always think about the overall meaning of the text (i.e., whether the text is negative, positive, etc.) to make sure that your answer choice fits the context.
