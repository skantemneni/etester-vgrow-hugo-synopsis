	<h3 class="skill-heading">Critical Reasoning</h3>
	<p>The questions on Critical Reasoning are meant to measure candidates' ability to read and comprehend a piece of written material, to reason and to evaluate arguments. Critical Reasoning questions are designed to test the reasoning skills involved in (a) making arguments (b) evaluating arguments and (c) formulating or evaluating a plan of action. In these questions, you are to analyse the situation on which each question in based, and then select the answer choice that most appropirately answers the question. Begin by read the passages carefully, then read the five answer choices. If the correct answer is not immediately obvious to you. see whether you can eliminate some of the wrong answers. Reading the passage a second time may be helpful in illuminating subtleties that were not immediately evident. <br />
		Answering critical reasoning questions requires no specialised knowledge of any particular field: you are not required to have knowledge of the terminology and conventions of formal logic. <br />
		Critical reasoning questions are designed of provide one measure of your ability to reason effectively in the following areas :</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Argument Construction</h4>
		<p>Questions in this category may ask you to recognise such things as the basic structure of an argument, properly drawn conclusions, underlying assumptions, well supported explanatory hypotheses and parallels between structurally similar arguments.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Argument Evaluation</h4>
		<p>These questions may ask you to analyse a given argument and to recognise such things as factors that would strengthen or weaken the given argument: reasoning errors committed in making that argument: and aspects of the method by which the argument proceeds.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Formulating and Evaluating a Plan of Action</h4>
		<p>to recognise such things as the relative appropriateness, effectiveness or efficiency of different plans of action: factors that would strengthen or weaken the prospects of success of a proposed plan of action: and assumptions underlying a proposed plan of action.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Strategies for Tackling Questions</h4>
		<p>Read very carefully the set of statements on which a question is based. Pay greater attention to:</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>What is put forward as factual information</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>What is not said but necessarily follows from what is said</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>What is claimed to follow from facts that have been put forward</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>How well substantiated are any claims that a particular conclusion follows from the facts that have been put forward</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>In reading the arguments, it is important to pay attention to the logical reasoning used; the actual truth of statements portrayed as fact is not important.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Identify the Conclusion</h4>
		<p>The conclusion does not necessarily come at the end of the text: it may come somewhere in the middle or even at the beginning. Be careful to clues in the text that an argument follows logically from another statement or statements in the text.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Determine Exactly what each Question Asks</h4>
		<p>might find it helpful to read the question first, before reading the material on which it is based: don't assume that you know what you will be asked about an argument. An argument may have obvious flaws, and one question may ask you to detect them. But another question may direct you to select the one answer choice that does not describe a flaw in the argument. <br />

			Despite repeated announcements that mobile phones were not allowed in the examination hall, three students were caught with their mobile phones.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>

					<p>Mobile phones nowadays have a lot of features and it is easy to cheat with their help</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The invigilator must immediately confiscate the mobile phones and ask the students to leave the exam hall immediately.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Mobile phones are very expensive and leaving them in bags outside the exam hall is not safe.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>There have been incidents where students who left the exam hall early stole the mobile phones kept in the bags of the students who were writing the exam</p>
