		<span class="highlight01"> What do we learn by " voice " ?</span>
		<br />
		Voice is the form of verb that shows whether the subject of a sentence does the action (the active voice) or is affected by it (passive voice).<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Examples :</span>
		<br />
		In the sentence "James hit the ball". The verb "hit" is in the active voice. In other words, the form "hit" shows that the subject (James) did the action. The sentence "James hit the ball" is an active sentence. In the sentence "The ball was hit by James", the verb "was hit" is the passive voice. In other words, the form "was hit" shows that the subject (The ball) was affected by the action. The sentence "The ball was hit by James" is a passive sentence. <br />
		Here are some more examples. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Active :</span>
		The boy played cricket. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Passive :</span>
		Cricket was played by the boy. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Active :</span>
		He wrote a letter. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Passive :</span>
		The mail was carried by the mailman. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Active :</span>
		Karan took a picture. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Passive :</span>
		A picture was taken by Karan. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Active :</span>
		They took the kids for a walk. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Passive :</span>
		The kids were taken for a walk by them. <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Active or Passive  ?</span>
		<br />
		Most of the sentences in English are active sentences. <br />
		And if you think about it, they tend to be much more simple than passive sentences. Have a look at these sentences and see for yourself: </p>
