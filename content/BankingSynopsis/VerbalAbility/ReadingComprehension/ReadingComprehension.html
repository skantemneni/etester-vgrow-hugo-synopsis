	<h3 class="skill-heading">Reading Comprehension</h3>
	<p> In this topic followed by ten to fifteen questions. Among these questions. some are general questions on what is said in the passage and some are on terms used in the passage.<br /> Generally some words or terms are printed in bold in the passage. Some questions relate to these words as antonyms and synonyms.<br />
		Clearly, a student must have a good knowledge of word-power and grammar and ability to understand a passage.</p>
	<p> Quite a few students believe that it is possible to understand the key idea of paragraph by just reading the first and the last sentence but this need not be necessarily true. </p>
	<p> "The level of comprehension" (understanding) of passage is a very wide term and this includes skills such as :</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>logical ability and the ability to infer</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>ability to link paragraph or analytical ability</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>ability to reason </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>ability to understand the motive of the author</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>reading speed</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>vocabulary power. and</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>retaining factual information to save time, otherwise you will always have to refer back and find out the required information which will necessarily consume valuable time.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p> Majority of the candidates believe in reading the questions first.<br />
		The assumption is that one will be able to find the answers faster in the text of the passage, if one knows the questions before reading the passage. <br />
		But there are three very good reason not to follow this technique.</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Firstly, it is not possible for anyone to remember all the questions as they are given at once.<br />
					Again, when one read the passage, one's stress will be on locating the answer to the questions and not on comprehending the central idea of the passage.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The order of the questions need not be progressive with the text. Thus, one may not be able to find the answers in the same order.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Now it is observed that most of the questions in reading comprehension are indirect.<br />
					Such questions may be of the following formats :
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>It can be inferred from the passage that ... (Implied Information)</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>According to the author (Main Idea)</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The passage is primarily concerned with ...	(Main Idea)</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The author's statement that...	(Specific Information)</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Which of the following describes the mood of the passage .... (Tone or Mood)</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The author implies that ... (Implied Information)</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The main purpose of the passage ...	(Main Idea)</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The author's tone is best described as ...	(Tone or Mood)</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>One could easily see the author as ...	(Implied Information)</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>This list may be still longer. The answers to such questions cannot be directly lifted from the text of the passage. One can answer these questions accurately only if one has a good comprehension of the passage. Therefore, reading such questions before reading the passage shall have no additional value and can only be a hindrance to comprehension.</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>The most important way to really understand what you are reading is to "get involved" with the passage.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>You should underline important parts of passage. The underlining will help you to answer questions. Practically a question will ask you to detect - the main idea <span class="highlight01"> or </span> the information that is specifically mentioned in the passage <span class="highlight01"> or </span> information that is implied (not directly) stated in the passage or the tone/mood of the passage.<br />
					If you find out quickly what the question is aiming for, you will arrive more easily at the correct answer by referring to your underlinings in the passage.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>While reading the passage you should translate the information contained in each para into your own language, by analysing the elements of the passage, recognising the relationship between these elements, seeking cause effect relationship, implications etc. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Encircle transitional and key words whilenreading the passage. The transitional words are "bridge" words that will help you to discover logical connections in the given passage. Encircling these transitional words will help you to get a better understanding of the passage.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Derive the meaning of "tough or unfamiliar" words by using the context method. Suppose, you don't know the meaning of a certain word in a passage, try to determine the meaning of that word from the context, i.e., from the words that are close in position to that word whose meaning you do not know. Often an author uses an unfamiliar word and then immediately defines it within the same sentence. Look at the words in the immediate vicinity of the word or phrase which appears to be tough or unfamiliar. These words will give you a sense of the meaning of the unfamiliar word.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>As you read each question, determine the type:
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01">Main Idea: </span> Selection of the main thought of the passage, ability to judge the general significance of the passage, ability to select the best title of the passage.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01">Detecting Details: </span> Ability to understand the author's explicit statement, to get the literal meaning of what is written, to identify details.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01">Inferential Reasoning : </span> Ability to weave together the ideas of a passage and to see their relationship or linking, to draw correct inferences, to go beyond literal interpretation to the implications of the statements.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01">Tone or Mood : </span> Ability to determine from the passage, the tone or mood that is dominant in the passage - humorous, serious, sad, mysterious, factual etc.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Do not answer a question on the basis of your own opinion. Answer each question on the basis of the information given or suggested in the passage itself. Your own views or judgements may sometimes conflict with what the author of the passage is expressing.Answer the question according to what the author believes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Look back at the passage when in doubt. Sometimes while you are answering a question, you are not quite sure whether you have chosen the correct answer. Often, the underlinings, that you have made while reading the passage, will help you to determine whether a certain choice is the only correct choice. Again, refer to the passage while answering factual questions.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>To answer questions on comprehension most effectively you should read the question and proceed to look at the alternative choices in the order of choices (1), (2),(3) and (4). If the first choice does not give you the definite feeling that it is correct, do not try analyse it further. Move to the second choice. Again, if that choice does not make you feel that it is correct one, and you really have to think carefully about the choice, go on the third choice. The choice that you feel first, is definitely correct (say choice 3) is the one you should mark. Do not bother about going on to the remaining choice. In other words, stop at the choice that you feel is obviously right one. Suppose, you have gone through all four choices, and you do not know which one is correct, or you do not see anyone that stands out as obviously being correct. then quickly guess or leave the question blank and go on to the next question. You may, quite possibly, come across the answer to the above question while working on
					the next question </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Increase your vocabulary to boost your score in the Comprehension Test. You can increase your vocabulary tremendously by learning affixes , roots etc. by reading as extensively as possible-novels, non-fictions  , newspapers, magazines, listening to the people who speak wet and by referring to dictionary often.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Passage</h4>
		<p>Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions given below it. Certain words have been printed in <span class="highlight01">bold</span>  to help you locate them while answering some of the questions. <br />
			The evolution of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) trend has been as profound as it has been rapid. It represents the more visible sign that the  boundaries between personal life and work life are blurring. The 9am - 5 pm model of working solely from office has become archaic and increasingly people are working extended hours from a range of locations. At the very heart of this evolution is the ability to access enterprise networks from anywhere and anytime. The concept cloud computing serves effectively to extend the office out of office. The much <span class="highlight01">heralded </span> benefit of BYOD is greater productivity. However, recent research has suggested that this is the greatest myth of BYOD and the reality is that BYOD in practice poses new challenges that may <span class="highlight01">outweigh </span> the benefits, A worldwide survey commissioned by Fortinet chose to look at attitudes towards BYOD and security from the user's point of view instead of the IT managers. Specifically the survey was conducted in 15 territories on a group of graduate employees in their early twenties because they represent the first generation to enter the workplace with an expectation of own device use. Moreover, they also reorescnt tomorrow's in fluencers and decision makers. The survey findings reveal that for financial organizations, the decision to <span class="highlight01">embrace </span> BYOD is extremely dangerous. Larger organizations will have mature IT strategies and policies in place. But what about smaller financial businesses? They might not have such well developed strategies to protect confidential data. <br />
			Crucially. within younger employee group, 55% of the people share an expectation that they should be allowed to use their own devices in the workplace or for work purposes. With this expectation comes the very real risk that employees may consider contravening company policy banning the use of own devices. The threats posed by this level of subversion cannot be overstated. The survey casts doubt on the idea of BYOD leading to greater productivity by revealing the real reason people want to use their own devices. Only 26% of people in this age group cite efficiency as the reason they want to use their own devices, while 63% admit that the main reason is so they have access to their favourite applications. But with personal applications so close to hand, the risks to the business must surely include distraction and time wasting. To support this assumption 46% of people polled acknowledged time wasting as the greatest threat to the organization, while 42% citing greater exposure to theft or loss of confidential data. Clearly, from a user perspective there is great deal of contradiction surrounding BYOD and there exists an undercurrent of selfishness where users expect to use their own devices, but mostly for personal interest. They recognize the risks to the organization but are adamant that those risks are worth taking.</p>
