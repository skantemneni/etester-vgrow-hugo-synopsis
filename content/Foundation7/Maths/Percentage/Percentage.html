		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Concept of percentage</h4>
		<p> The word percentage means per hundred. By certain percent, we mean that many hundredths. Thus, x percent means x hundredths, written as x%. Information conveyed in percentage does not give the exact but gives an approximation. <br />
			To express x% as a fraction: We have, x% = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{x}{100}.  \) </span>
			<br />
			Thus, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  20 \% = \frac{20}{100} = \frac{1}{5}; \ 48 \% = \frac{48}{100} = \frac{12}{25}  \) </span>, etc. <br />
			To express <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{a}{b}  \) </span> as a percent: We have, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{a}{b} = \left( \frac{a}{b} \times 100 \right) \%  \) </span>
			<br />
			Thus, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{4} = \left( \frac{1}{4} \times 100 \% \right) = 25 \% ; \ 0.6 = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5} = \left( \frac{3}{5} \times 1000 \right) \% = 60 \%  \) </span>
		</p>
		<p> If the price of a commodity increases by R%, then the reduction in consumption so as not to increase the expenditure is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left[ \frac{R}{(100 + R)} \times 100 \% \right] \%  \) </span>
		</p>
		<p>If the price of a commodity decreases by R%, then the increase in consumption so as not to decrease the expenditure is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left[ \frac{R}{(100 - R)} \times 100 \% \right] \%  \) </span>

		<p> Charan has a saving account with an interest rate of 5% p.a. and a fixed deposit scheme with an interest rate of 10.5% p.a. in Central Bank. After he deposite Rs. 17,000 in both, he received a total interest of Rs. 1,510, after one year. How much money is deposited in the fixed deposit account?</p>	
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Let the amount deposited by Charan in fixed deposit be Rs. x. <br />
			So money in savings account = (17,000 - x) <br />
			Interest got from fixed deposit = 10.5% of x = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{10.5}{100} \times x  \) </span>
			<br />
			Interest got from savings account = 5% of (17,000 - x) = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{5}{100} (17, 000 - x)  \) </span>
			<br />
			Total interest received = Rs. 1,510 <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  i.e.,  \frac{10.5 x}{100} + \frac{5(17000 - x)}{100} = 1,510 \\\\[3pt]
				\frac{10.5x + 85000 - 5x}{100} = 1,510  \\\\[3pt]
				5.5x + 85,000 = 1,510 \times 100  \\\\[3pt]
				5.5x = 1,51,000 - 85,000 = 66,000  \\\\[3pt]
				x = \frac{66000 \times 10}{55 \times 10} = Rs. 12,000 \end{align}  \) </span>
