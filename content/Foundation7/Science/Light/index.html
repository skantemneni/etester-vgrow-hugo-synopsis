	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Light can be defined as a form of energy. It helps us to see things. Photosynthesis is one of the process by which plants prepare their own food for their growth in the presence of sunlight. Light energy is an invisible form of energy that causes sensation of vision.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Source of light</h4>
		<p>An object that emits light is called a source of light. The Sun, the stars and the glowworm are some of the natural sources of light, whereas, oil lamps, candles, electric lights are examples of artificial sources of light. Objects that give off their own light are called luminous objects and the objects that do not give off their own light are called the non-luminous objects. The non-luminous objects can be seen due to the light reflected by luminous objects.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Optical Medium</h4>
		<p>The term medium is used for any substance through which light might pass. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Example </span>
			<br />
			Glass, water, air etc.,</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Transparent medium</h5>
		<p>Substances that allow most of the light to pass through them are called transparent substance. We can see through them clearly. A transparent substance is called an optical medium. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Example </span>
			<br />
			Glass, water, air etc., </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Translucent medium</h5>
		<p>Substances which allows only apart of the light to pass through it and through which object cannot be distinctly seen. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Example </span>
			<br />
			Butter paper, paraffin wax, greased paper, ground glass etc., </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Opaque medium</h5>
		<p> Opaque object is one that does not allow any light to pass through it. They reflect or absorb all the light that falls on them. We cannot see through them.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Example </span>
			<br />
			Wood, stone, rubber, walls, books etc.,<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Homogeneous Medium </span>
			<br />
			An optical medium which has uniform composition, throughout is called homogeneo medium. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Example </span>
			<br />
			Glass, diamond, distilled water, a sheet of clear plastic, vacuum, pure alcohol etc., <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Heterogeneous  Medium </span>
			<br />
			An optical medium which has different composition at different points is called heterogeneous medium. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Example </span>
			<br />
			Air, muddy water, fog, mist, smoke of clouds etc.,</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Point source of light</h4>
		<p>If a screen with a pin hole is placed infront of a lighted bulb then a point source of ligh is obtained. From the point source, light propagates uniformly in all directions.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">A ray</h4>
		<p>Light from a point source spreads out in all directions. The directions of a very narro path of light is known as a ray of light. <br />
			A ray of light is represented by a straight line with an arrow head. The arrow head on gives the direction of light. <br />

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">parallel beam of light</h5>

		<p>There are two types of reflection: Regular (or specular) and Diffuse (or irregul reflections. In regular reflection, the light is reflected in one direction only. This occ on smooth surfaces such as mirrors. In irregular reflection, light is reflected through range of different angles. This occurs on rough surfaces such as paper, corrugated gl or a painted wall. The surface of an ordinary paper may appear smooth, but if s under a microscope, it will appear rough with many small protrusions. </p>
