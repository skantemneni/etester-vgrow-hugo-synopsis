	<h3 class="skill-heading">Acid</h3>
	<p>Acids belong to an important class of compounds. The word acid is derived from the Latin word acidus meaning sour. All acids have one property in common - they are sour to taste. Numerous acids occur in nature. Oranges and lemons contain citric acid, apples contain malic acid. Luscious tomatoes are rich in oxalic acid. Tamarind and grapes contain tartaric acid. Lactic acid is found in sour milk. The above acids are organic acids.<br />
		In the laboratory we mainly use hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid and nitric acid. These aye mineral acids. These acids are corrosive and must be handled with care.</p>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Indicators</h5>
		<p>An indicator is a substance which shows the presence of a chemical substance by changing color. A commonly used acid - base indicator is litmus paper. Acids turn blue litmus red and bases turn red litmus blue. Methyl orange and phenolphthalein are other indicators. And some of the natural indicators are turmeric powder (haldi), china rose (ghulal) and raw beet root juice. The bright orange yellow turmeric solution changes to a brick red color when comes in contact with an alkali.</p>

			<span class="highlight01"> Indigestion treatment: </span>

			<span class="highlight01">  Curing BCC/Ant sting : </span>
			<br />
			The sting of an ant or the ee is very painful, because such insects inject some acidic liquid (formic acid) intoe skin. The effect of the sting can  be neutralised by rubbing baking soda, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (NaHCO_3) \) </span> or calamine solution (zinc carbonate). <br />
			<span class="highlight01">  Soil Treatment : </span>
			<br />
			Excessive use of chemical fertilisers make the soil acidic. Plants don't grow well on such soil. Such soil needs to be treated with bases like quick lime (CaO) or slaked lime <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (Ca(OH)_2)  \) </span>. If the soil is basic, organic matter is added to it which releases acid to neutralise the basic nature of the soil. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Waste Treatment :  </span>
			<br />
			Factory wastes containing acids are treated with bases before being released to flow into water bodies. Unless treated such wastes are harmful and may damage the living organisms in water.					   </p>
