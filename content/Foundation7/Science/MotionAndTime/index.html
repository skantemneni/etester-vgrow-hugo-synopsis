	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p> In our daily life, we observe vehicles moving on a road, the motion of the birds in the sky, the motion of the blades of a fan etc., In all these examples we observe that the bodies are under motion. In the contrary, a body can also be under rest. To understand rest and motion their basic definition need to be defined. The basic definition of motion and rest are defined in this chapter. Apart from this the physical quantities related to the motion are studied under this topic.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Motion</h4>
		<p>A body is said to move only when it changes its position in space from one point to another point. In physics, just changing the position is not motion. Change of position with respect to surroundings and time is said to be motion. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Rest</h4>
		<p>When a body is not changing the position with respect to surroundings and time it is said to be at rest. To make it clear, it can be understood by the following example : When you are standing on a railway platform in front of another standing person, you are at rest (in this surrounding). However, to a person in a moving train, both of you appear to be moving (this surrounding is different). In a moving bus, the passenger who sits along with you is at rest, however to a person on the road, both of you appear to be in motion. Therefore, rest and motion are relative terms. They are not absolute terms.</p>

	<p>Distance travelled by a body is the length of the path taken irrespective of the direction of motion. SI unit of distance travelled is meter (m).</p>

	<p>Displacement of a body is the shortest distance travelled in a direction from initial to final point. SI unit of displacement is the meter (m) while its CGS unit is centimeter (cm). <br />
		The following example will elucidate it. If your house is situated far away from your school, different paths (routes) you travel to reach the school constitute distances. On the other hand the straight line path (actual distance) between your house and school can be termed as displacement.</p>

		If someone states that speed of a running boy is  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2 m \ s^{-1}  \) </span>, it is very clear that he covers 2 m in one second.

		<p>  Harish and Mohan start from home at the same time and travel by different routes to school. Harish's house is at a distance of 1500 m from the school while Mohan's house is at 2000 m from the school. Both reach school at the same time. Who travelled faster?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Speed depends on both time and distance. In order to decide who travelled faster, Harish or Mohan, we have to compare the distance travelled by each in a fixed interval of time. Let's say both take 20 minutes to reach school. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \therefore \ \text{Speed of Harish} = \frac{distance \ travelled}{Time \ taken} = \frac{1500}{20} = 7.5 \ m \ min^{-1}  \\\\[3pt]
