	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>A comb attracts bits of paper after being rubbed with dry hair, the cracking sound made by nylon or terylene socks when taken off from our body etc., are some of the phenomenon observed in our daily life. These phenomenon are studied under the topic electrostatics in physics. <br />
		Electrostatics is the study of static electric charges. In nature, there are two types of electric charges, i.e., positive (+) charges and negative (-) charges.
	</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Electric Charge</h4>
		<p> Every substance is made up of atoms containing equal numbers of positive and negative charges. A positively charged body has more positive charges and a negatively charged body has more negative charges. Electric charges can exist independently either as positive or negative charges. The SI unit of electric charge is the coulomb represented by the symbol 'C'.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Electrification</h3> 
	<p>Electrification is a process by which a body is electrified. </p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Methods of Electrification</h4>
		<p>A body can be charged by one of the methods such as friction, contact or conduction and induction.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Charging by friction</h5>
		<p>If a body is charged by rubbing it against another body, then the process of charging is called charging by friction. In this process one body looses some electrons and the second body gains the same number of electrons. <br />
			Insulators do not contain free electrons that move about from one atom to another like in metals. So they do not conduct electricity like metals. However, they can be charged by rubbing with a suitable material. They generate static electricity due to friction. Some examples are:</p> 
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>A perspex (an acrylic plastic material) rod on the other hand becomes positively charged if rubbed with a woolen cloth. In this case, the electrons are transferred from Perspex to the cloth and the cloth becomes negatively charged. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>When we rub a glass rod with silk, then some of the electrons from the glass rod are transferred to the silk. Since the glass rod has a deficiency of electrons as compared to the protons in its nucleus, therefore, it gets positively charged. At the same time the silk tend to have an excess of electrons as compared to protons and, therefore, gets negatively charged.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Cellulose Acetate (also a type of plastic material) rod when rubbed with wool becomes positively charged.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>When we rub an ebonite rod with the cat's skin, some of the electrons from the cat's skin transferred to the ebonite rod. As the ebonite rod has excess of electrons as compared to protons, therefore, it gets negatively charged. At the same time as the cat's skin has deficiency of electrons as compared to the protons, therefore, it gets
						positively charged.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Rubber rod when rubbed with hair or fur becomes negatively charged.</p>
				</li>

		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>It must be remembered that during positive or negative electrification, it is the electrons and not the protons which get transferred.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If one body gets positively charged due to rubbing, for rubbing gets negatively charged at the same time. Thus, equal and opposite electric charges are produced at the same time.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Conduction</h4>
		<p>If a body is charged by contact with another charged body, then the process is called charging by conduction. In this process the body acquires the same charge and the total charge is shared by the two bodies.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Charging by induction</h4>
		<p>If a body is charged by the presence of another charged body without contact, then the process is called charging by induction. In this process charge acquired by the body is equal and opposite to the charge on the charging body. Here there is no sharing of charges but only redistribution of charges on the body. <br />

	<h3 class="skill-subheading">Electroscope</h3>
	<p>An Electroscope is an instrument for detecting the presence of very weak electrical charges and for determining whether that charge is positive or negative. <br />
		Two types of electroscopes are the pith ball electroscope and the gold leaf electroscope.</p>  
	<section class="subskill">

		 </div> 
		<p>If a dry glass rod is rubbed against silk and brought near the pith ball, it is attracted to it (as in fig. i), because an opposite charge develops in it due to induction. When the pith ball touches the rod (as in fig. ii), it is repelled (as in fig. iii), since both have the same charge due to conduction.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Gold - Leaf Electroscope</h4>
		<p>A gold-leaf electroscope consists of two gold leaves fixed to the lower end of a brass rod that they hang parallel to each other. This brass rod passes through an insulating cork, say of ebonite, fitted on the mouth of a glass vessel. At the upper end of the rod, there is a brass disc.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image">

		<p>When a gold leaf electroscope is uncharged, the gold leaves remains collapsed (remains p arallel). <br />
			In charging by contact, the gold leaves receive the same kind of charge as on the charging body. <br />
			The gold leaves, being similarly charged, repel each other and therefore diverge. They remain diverged even after the charged rod is removed.</p>	
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Lightening</h5>
		<p>Lightening occurs when charge jumps from one cloud to another, or from clouds to objects on the earth. <br />
			Lightening is a gigantic electric discharge occurring between two charged clouds or between a cloud and the Earth. It was the American inventor, Benjamin Franklin (1706 - 1790), who showed that lightening was static electricity, formed by the friction between droplets and particles (ice crystals) in rain clouds. <br />
			An electric discharge due to lightening, passing through a building can cause damage to the building. However, buildings can be protected from such a damage if a lightening conductor is installed in the building. <br />
			A lightening rod consists of a thick copper strip fixed to an outside wall of a building. It reaches above the highest part of the building terminating is sharp spikes. Its lower end is terminated on a metal plate buried in the ground.the lightening rod intercepts the cloud discharges (and flash to the Earth) before it reaches the threatened building and passes the current harmlessly to the ground.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question"> Example 1:</h4>
		<p>Ordinary rubber is an insulator, But the special rubber tyres of air crafts are made slightly conducting. Why is this necessary?</p> 
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br /> 
			An aeroplane flying through the air can become charged with static electricity and due to the high potential difference between it and the earth, there is a possibility of charges escaping to earth as sparks during refuelling, which could cause an explosion. So. it is necessary to earth the plane with a conductor as soon as it lands. For this purpose. the aircraft tyres are made of slightly conductive rubber and hence, the static electricity is discharged on landing.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="solved-example"> 
		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
		<p>How the lightening takes place. Explain the importance of lightening conductors.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Lightening is due to large amount of static electricity built up in the heavy thunderclouds. This is caused by friction between the water molecules in the thunder clouds and the air molecules in the atmosphere. When the static electricity is sufficiently large, it can ionize the air and create a conducting path to be discharged to a nearest or sharpest object on the ground. Due to the flow of a large quantity of charge in a short time, a lightening can cause damage to life and property. Hence, tall buildings are protected with a lightening conductor which consists of sharp metal spikes placed on top of building and connected by copper strips to a metal plate in the ground. This will prevent lightening from striking the building.</p>
