	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Air is neither a pure substance nor a single gas. It is a mixture of gases, important among them being nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor. The other minor constituents include noble gases or inert gases like helium, neon, argon, krypton.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Atmosphere</h4>  
		<p>Air is present all around us. All living things need air to breathe. We breathe in the oxygen that is present in the air.<br />
			The blanket of air that surrounds the earth is called atmosphere. It extends hundreds of kilometers above the earth. It acts as a shield for the earth.<br />
			The atmosphere is thick near the surface of the earth. It gets thinner as we go higher up. After a few hundred kilometers, the atmosphere ends and space begins. Space has no air.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Layers of the atmosphere</h4>  
		<p>The atmosphere has five layers. These are troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and exosphere.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Troposphere</h5>  
		<p>The troposphere is the lowermost layer of the atmosphere. It extends upto 15 kilometers above the surface of the earth. All weather changes take place in this layer.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Stratosphere</h5>  
		<p>The stratosphere starts from where the troposphere ends and extends to about 35 kilometers. Compared to the troposphere, this layer of the atmosphere is less dense. The ozone layer, which absorbs the sun's ultra - violet rays, is located in this layer. Jet planes usually fly in this layer.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Mesosphere</h5>  
		<p>Beyond the stratosphere lies the mesosphere. In this layer, temperature begins to fail as we go higher. That it is known as the 'cold layer'.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Thermosphere</h5>  
		<p>The thermosphere is called the 'hot layer' because it is characterized by high temperatures. Space shuttles orbit in this layer. <br />
			Another layer, called ionosphere is a part of the thermosphere. The radio signals transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer. So long distance radio communication is possible because of the ionosphere.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Exosphere</h5>  
		<p>This is the outermost layer of the atmosphere. The air here is very thin. Beyond the exosphere is vast, empty space.</p>

		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>It dilutes the activity of oxygen. Thus, the combustion of fuel during burning takes place at moderate rate.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The compounds of nitrogen are of vital importance to plants as they help the plants to manufacture proteins. However, free nitrogen cannot be absorbed by plants. The free nitrogen is converted into its compounds by the following natural methods:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>During lightning, an electric spark passes through air. Due to this spark, nitrogen combines with oxygen to form nitric oxide gas. <br />
								<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Nitrogen}{N_2} + \underset{Oxygen}{O_2}  \underset{spark}{\overset{electric}{\rightleftharpoons}} \underset{Nitric \ oxide \ gas}{2 NO}  \) </span>
								<br />
								The nitric oxide gas, further reacts with oxygen and water vapor present in air to form nitric acid vapor.<br />
								<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \underset{Nitric \ oxide \ gas}{2No} + \underset{Oxygen}{O_2}  \rightarrow \underset{Nitric \ dioxide \ gas}{2 NO_2}  \\\\[3pt]
									\underset{Nitric \ dioxide \ gas}{2No} + \underset{Oxygen}{O_2} + \underset{water}  \rightarrow \underset{Nitric \ acid}{4 HNO_3}  \end{align}  \) </span>
								<br /> 
								When it rains, the nitric acid in very dilute from is washed down to earth, where it reacts with soil carbonates to from soil nitrates.	<br />
								<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Calcium \ carbonate}{CaCO_3} \rightarrow \underset{Calcium \ nitrate}{Ca(NO_3)_2} +  \underset{Carbon \ dioxide}{CO_2} + \underset{Water}{H_2 O}  \) </span>
								<br />
								The soil nitrates, so formed, act as excellent food for the growth of plants </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Symbiotic bacteria are present in nodules of pod bearing plants such as peas, grams, sweet peas, etc., The bacteria absorb nitrogen directly from air and convert it into compounds of nitrogen. These compounds are absorbed by the plants for the manufacture of proteins.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Nitrogen being active gas is used in the preservation of foods. The containers containing food are flushed with nitrogen to drive out oxygen and then sealed. Because, of the absence of oxygen, the bacteria do not grow and hence food remains fresh.</p>

				<li>
					<p>It is essential for the combustion of fuels. Man burns an enormous amount of fuels for his energy needs. Oxygen helps in the combustion of fuels to form carbon dioxide and water vapor as principal products.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In nature, it dissolves in water. This, in turn, helps to keep the water fresh and is a source of respiration for water animals.</p>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Carbon dioxide, dissolved in water, can dissolve rocks containing calcium carbonate (chalk) or magnesium carbonate. The salts, so formed, are calcium bicarbonate and magnesium bicarbonate. These dissolved salts give taste to natural water. Furthermore, they satisfy the needs of plants for growth, as calcium and magnesium ions are needed by the plants.<br />

		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>The presence of water vapor in air determines climatic conditions. Excessive water vapor causes rain. The amount of rain produced depends upon the geographical location and the surrounding. Depending upon the temperature, the water vapor produces snow, fog, mist, hails and other phenomenon.</p>
				</li>
				<li>

					<p>Basically there are two types of fire extinguishers which make use of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  CO_2  \) </span>:<br />
						The liquid carbon dioxide extinguisher, and <br />
						The water - type extinguisher.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The liquid carbon dioxide extinguisher consists of a bottle containing pressurized carbon dioxide, which is sprayed out through a nozzle. The initial jet that comes out vaporizes and creates such a low temperature that the carbon dioxide solidifies. The fine particles of solidified carbon dioxide are sprayed on to the flames. The particles vaporize and form a dense layer of carbon dioxide gas, which breaks the contact between air and the fire, and also lowers the temperature of the burning material. This helps to extinguish the fire.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>A water - type extinguisher is filled with a concentrated solution of sodium carbonate <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   (Na_2CO_3)  \) </span> in water. Inside the solution is a small bottle containing <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   H2_SO_4  \) </span>. By striking the plunger of the extinguisher against a hard surface, the bottle gets shattered. The acid reacts with sodium carbonate to form <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  CO_2  \) </span> gas, an the water and the gas rush out of the nozzle. The fire loses contact with air and is extinguished. <br />

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 1:</h4>
		<p>Why do mountaineers carry oxygen cylinders with them?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			As we move high up in the atmosphere the air becomes thinner. Hence the amount of oxygen becomes less and with increase in height. It becomes difficult to breathe.</p>

		<p>Why glass panels usually appear hazy? </p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />

		<p>Winds are caused by the unequal heating of different parts of the earth. Justify. </p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			When a place gets heated by the sun, the air above it also gets heated. As you have read in the chapter on heat, when air is heated it expands and becomes lighter. The warmer, lighter air rises, and cooler, denser air blows in from the neighbouring areas. This movement of air is what we call wind.

		<p>Why is sulphuric acid not used in the preparation of carbon dioxide using calcium carbonate?</p>

			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			If dilute sulphuric acid is used instead of dilute hydrochloric acid, initially the reaction starts. <br />

		<p>Why is air a mixture but not a compound?</p> 
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The composition of air is not constant but varies slightly from place to place. For in. stance, oxygen is slightly less abundant at higher altitudes that at lower levels. The proportion of water vapour and solid particles too, is not constant. This shows that air is a mixture and not a compound.</p>
