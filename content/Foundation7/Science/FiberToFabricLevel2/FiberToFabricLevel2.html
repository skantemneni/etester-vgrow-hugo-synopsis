	<p>Heat is a form of energy which produces a sensation in our body by way of which we make out whether a body is cold, warm or hot. Hence it has the ability to do work. For example, the steam engine pulls a train converting heat into mechanical energy. Heat can also be converted to other forms Fibre to Fabric - Level 2 <br />
		substances, which are not obtained from plant or animal sources. These are called synthetic fibres. Some examples of synthetic fibres are polyester, nylon and acrylic.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Some Plant Fibres</h4> 
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Cotton</h5> 
		<p>Have you ever made wicks for oil lamps? What do you use for making these wicks? This cotton wool is also used for filling mattresses, quilts or pillows. <br />
			Take some cotton wool, pull it apart and look at its edges. What do you observe? The small, thin strands that you see are made up of cotton fibres. <br />
			Where does this cotton wool come from? It is grown in the fields. Cotton plants are usually grown at places having black soil and warm climate. Can you name some states of our country where cotton is grown? The fruits of the cotton plant (cotton bolls) are about the size of a lemon. After maturing, the bolls burst open and the seeds covered with cotton fibres can be seen. Have you ever</p>

		<p>seen a cotton field that is ready for picking? It looks like a field covered with snow (Fig.1). <br />
			rom these bolls, cotton is usually picked by hand. Fibres are then separated from the seeds by combing. This process is called ginning of cotton. Ginning was traditionally done by hand (Fig.2). These days, machines are also used for ginning.</p>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Jute</h5> 
		<p>Jute fibers is obtained from the stem of the jute plant (Fig 3). It is cultivated during the rainy season. In India, jute is mainly grown in West Bengal, Bihar and Assam. The jute plant is normally harvested when it is at flowering stage. The stems of the harvested plants are immersed in water for a few days. The stems rot and fibers are separated by hand</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Yarn to Fabric</h4>
		<p>There are many ways by which fabrics are made from yarns. The two main processes are weaving and knitting.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Weaving</h5> 
		<p>A fabric is made up of two sets of yarns arranged together. The process of arranging two sets of yarns together to make a fabric is called weaving. Let us try to weave some paper strips.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Knitting</h5> 
		<p>Have you noticed how sweaters are knitted? In knitting, a single yarn is</p>

		 </div>
		<p>used to make a piece of fabric (Fig. 5). Have you ever pulled the yarn from a torn pair of socks? What happens? A single yarn gets pulled out continuously as the fabric gets unravelled. Socks and many other clothing items are made of knitted fabrics. Knitting is done by hand and also on machines. <br />

			Paheli wants to know if you have seen any fabrics that are made of the fibres on the outer covering of coconut. What are these fibres normally used for? <br />
			Weaving and knitting are used for making different kinds of fabric. These fabrics are used for a variety of clothing items.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">History of Clothing Material</h4> 
		<p>Have you ever wondered what materials people used in ancient times for clothes? It appears that in those times people used the bark and big leaves of trees or animal skins and furs to cover themselves. <br />
			After people began to settle in agricultural communities, they learnt to weave twigs and grass into mats and baskets. Vines, animal fleece or hair were twisted together into long strands. These were woven into fabrics. The early Indians wore fabrics made out of cotton that grew in the regions near the river Ganga. Flax is also a plant that gives natural fibres. In ancient Egypt, cotton as well as flax were cultivated near the river Nile and were used for making fabrics. <br />
			In those days, stitching was not known. People simply draped the fabrics around different parts of their body. Many different ways of draping fabrics were used. With the invention of the sewing needle, people started stitching fabrics to make clothes. Stitched clothes have gone through many variations since this invention. But, is it not amazing that even today saree, dhoti, lungi or turban is used as an un-stitched piece of fabric? <br />
			Just as there is a large variety in the food eaten all over our country, a large variety exists also in fabrics and clothing items.</p>
