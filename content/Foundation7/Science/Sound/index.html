	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3> 
	<p>Sound is a form of energy. It causes sensation of hearing. Sound is produced by vibrating bodies. When a particle (or body) moves to and fro about its mean position, it is said to vibrate. Every source of sound is a vibrating body. In laboratory, a tuning fork is used to produce sound.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Production of sound</h4>
		<p>Sound is a mechanical wave and is normally associated with our sense of hearing. Sound is produced by vibrating sources in a material medium. Medium can be any gas, liquid or solid. A tuning fork, a violin string and a loudspeaker are examples that produce sound. This is because they are all in a state of vibration. The energy of the sound waves is propagated and carried by colliding particles of a material medium. Sound travels faster in denser media. It travels faster in liquids than in gases and fastest in solids.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Sound cannot travel through vacuum</h4>
		<p>Sound is produced by vibrating body. It transmitted in the form of mechanical waves. Thus, sound requires a material medium for its propagation. Sound can travel through solids, liquids and gases. Sound travels much better in solids and at a very high speed as compared to liquids and gases. In case of liquids, sound travels much better than in gases and at a higher speed. From the above discussion, it can be understood that sound cannot travel through vacuum. It can be illustrated using following experiment.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Experiment</h5>
		<p>Take an electric bell and fit an electric bell through an air tight cork as shown in figure. Place the bell jar on the platform of vacuum pump and apply a little grease at its edges, so as to make it air tight. Now press the key. It is possible to hear the sound of the bell, as its hammer strikes against the gong. Now start the vacuum pump. It will be observed that as the air is withdrawn from the bell jar, the loudness of sound of the bell decreases.Furthermore, when a vacuum is created, no sound is heard, inspite of the fact that hammer is striking against the gong. Stop the vacuum pump and allow the air to enter in bell jar. The sound of the bell is heard again. This experiment proves that sound cannot travel through vacuum and material medium is necessary for the propagation of sound.</p>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Determining the speed of sound in air</h5>
		<p>The speed of sound can be determined by direct method using only two measurements.</p>

		 </div>
		<p>The distance of the sound source from the receiver. <br />
			The time taken for the sound wave to travel that distance. <br />
			The speed of the sound can then be calculated using the formula: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  speed = \frac{\text{distance travelled}}{time}  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Why is the thunder heard after the flash of lightening? </h5>
		<p>Light travels with a gpeed of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3 \times 10^8 \ m \ s^{-1}  \) </span> whereas the sound travels in air at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  330 m s^{-1}  \) </span>. Thus, whenever lightening takes place, it can be seen first, whereas sound will take some to reach us, depending upon the height of cloud. This fact can be used for finding the height of a cloud where lightening takes place.<br />
			Hold a stopwatch in your hand on a rainy day. As soon as you see the flash of lightening, start the stopwatch. The moment you hear the sound of thunder, stop the stopwatch. Let us imagine that time gap in seeing the lightening flash and hearing the sound of thunder is T s. Knowing the velocity of sound in air as <span lang ="latex"> 330 \ m \ s^{-1} </span> we can find the height of cloud as under: <br />
			Height of the cloud = Speed of sound in air <span lang ="latex"> \times </span> Time.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">some Common Terms used in Sound </h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Amplitude</h5>
		<p>The maximum displacement of a vibrating body from its mean position is called amplitude. If a stationary body is struck slowly or with less force, it has less amplitude. However, if same body is struck hard, it has a large amplitude.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Frequency</h5>
		<p>The number of vibrations produced by a vibrating body in one second is called frequency.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Units of frequency</h5>
		<p>The unit of frequency in SI system is hertz (Symbol Hz). When a vibrating body produces one vibration in one second, then its frequency is said to be one hertz. If the frequency of a tuning fork is 256 Hz, it means it is producing 256 vibrations in one second.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Bigger Units of Frequency</h5>
		<p>Bigger units of frequency are kilohertz (symbol kHz) and megahertz (MHz).</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol> 
				<li>
					<p>1 kHz = 1000 Hz</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>1 MHz = 1000,000 Hz</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Time period</h5>
		<p>The time in which a vibrating body completes one vibration is called time period. It is denoted by letter T. <br />
			If 'f' is frequency of vibrating body and 'T' the time period, then: <br />
			f vibrations are completed in = 1 s. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> one vibration is completed in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{f} s  \) </span>
			<br />
			But time taken to complete one vibration is its time period (T). <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore \ T = \frac{1}{f}  \) </span> i.e., Time period = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{Frequency} \) </span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Do All vibrations produce sound</h4> 
		<p>Human ear is not sensitive to vibrations of all frequencies. If the frequency of the vibrations is less than 20 Hz, then human ear cannot perceive them. Such vibrations are called subsonic vibrations or infrasonic vibrations. <br />
			If the frequency of vibrations is between 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, then they, can be perceived by human ear. Such vibrations are called sonic vibrations or sound vibrations. It has been further found that the higher the frequency, the sharper or shriller is the effect of sound on the ears. <br />
			However, if the frequency of vibrations is above, 20,000 Hz, then they can be Perceived by human ear However, if the frequency of vibrations is above 20,000 Hz, then the human ear cannot perceive them. Such vibrations are called ultrasonic vibrations or ultrasonics.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">	Reflection</h3> 
	<p>Like light, sound also obeys the laws of reflection when sound is reflected from hard smooth surfaces. The following experiment given below is used to illustrate reflection of sound. <br />
		Take two metal tubes place them inclined to each other such that they point towards a vertical flat surface of a drawing board. At one end of the tube place a ticking watch. At the other end place your ear by adjusting the position we hear the maximum loudness of the sound. Thus on measuring angle i and r shown in the figure it is observed that they are equal proving that sound obeys laws of reflection.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Absorption of Sound (Sound Insulation)</h4>
		<p>It has been found that shining objects like mirrors, metals or hard objects like buildings or stones reflect sound. However, materials with loose texture absorb sound. For example, curtains, gunny bags, straw, carpets, etc., absorb sound. <br />
			Big cinema half or auditoriums are carpeted and their walls are coated with some rough materials, so that they do not reflect any sound. It is because, such places are very big and therefore, echoes are formed. Thus, the quality of sound heard by people becomes poor. <br />
			However, in ordinary rooms in which we live, we do not have this problem. It is because they are seldom 17 m or more long or wide. Thus, the original sound and reflected sound reach the ears almost at the same time, and hence, no echo is formed. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Note:</span>
		</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Reflection of sound takes place only from hard and polished surface.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The angle of incidence is always equal to angle ofreflection.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Echoes</h4>
		<p>If you stand in front of a high building or a hillock, such that you are at a distance of more than 20 m and shout loudly, you will notice that you can hear your own sound. It is because the sound is reflected from the building. This hearing of reflected sound is called echo. <br />
			Human ear can hear two sounds separately only, if they reach the ear after an interval of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{10}  \) </span> of a second. This is natural feature of any human ear. The average speed of sound is 332 m s-'. Thus, in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{10}  \) </span> of a second the sound will travel a distance of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  332 \ m s^{-1} \div \frac{1}{10} = 33.2 \ m \) </span>. This means if a sound which starts from a point, on reflection from some hard object comes back to same point, then the distance between the reflecting body and source of sound should be <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  33.2 \ m \div 2  \) </span> = 16.6 m  or 17 m (approx). This hearing of a reflected sound from a reflecting body is called an echo. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Example </span>
			<br />
			If you have to address a small gathering inside a room everyone can hear you at your normal voice. However, if you address the same gathering in the open air, you have to speak loudly so that every one can hear you. <br />
			It is because, when you speak inside a room, the sound waves spread through the air in all directions. Some sound waves reach our ears directly and some strike the walls of the room and get reflected. These reflected waves also reach our ear almost at the same time. As more waves reach the ear, therefore, everyone hear, even if you speak softly. <br />
			However, in the open, only direct sound waves reach the ear, as there are no reflected waves, Thus, the ear receives less energy, and hence, you have to speak loudly. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Note </span>
			<br />
			It has been found that an echo can be heard only, if:</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>There is a high rise building or hill.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Minimum distance between source of sound and reflecting body is 17 m.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The loudness of the sound should be sufficient so that it can be heard after reflection.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Sonar</h4>
		<p>A device fitted in a ship to find the depth of sea is called sonar. It is based on the principle of reflection of sound. From the point A, ultrasonic vibrations are sent. These vibrations after striking the sea bed, are reflected upward and are picked up at point B. The time in which reflected sound is received is recorded.</p>

		<p>Knowing the speed of sound in water <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (1500 \ m \ s^{-1} )  \) </span> and the time taken for the reflected sound to reach the sonar, the depth can be calculated as illustrated by the example given below. <br />
			Let us suppose that it takes 2.4 s to receive the reflected sound. It is clear that for 1.2 s the sound must have travelled downward and for another 1.2 s it must have travelled upward. <br />
			Now, <br />
			Speed of sound in water  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{\text{Distance covered by sound}}{Time}  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1500 \frac{m}{s} = \frac{\text{Distance covered by sound}}{1.2 s}  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Distance covered by sound = 1500 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> 1.2 = 1800 m <br />

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Characteristics of sound</h4>
		<p>The human ear distinguishes the characteristics of sound. These are loudness, pitch and quality or timbre where each refers to a sensation in the consciousness of the listener.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Loudness</h5>
		<p> It is, easy to distinguish among loud and soft sounds. The term loudness of a sound is self-descriptive. It depends primarily on the amplitude of the sound wave.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104260005_image-5.png" alt="image-5" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>The larger the amplitude, the louder the sound (relative). <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Note: </span>
			<br />
			The standard unit of sound level is decibel. A sound is judged to be twice as loud as another, if its sound level is about 10 decibels higher.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Pitch</h5>
		<p>The pitch of a sound refers to whether it is high (sharp), like the sound of a violin, or low, like the sound of a bass drum. The physical quantity that determines pitch is the frequency. <br />
			The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch (relative).</p> 
		<div class="synopsis-image">

		 </div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Quality or Timbre</h5>
		<p>The property due to which two notes of same pitch and loudness produced by two different vibrating bodies can be distinguished, is called quality of sound. <br />
			This quality of sound is due to the formation of other notes which are produced (hie to the vibration of various parts of musical instruments and their shapes.</p>

(Taking velocity of sound through water = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1531 \ m \ s^{-1}  \) </span>)</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Let the depth of water be 'd'. Distance travelled by the pulses is going down towards bottom and reflecting upwards to the surface is s = 2 d <br />
			time taken 't' = 2 s, Depth of water = d = ? <br />
			we know, s = vt <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Rightarrow  \) </span> 2d = vt <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Rightarrow \ d = \frac{vt}{2} \Rightarrow \ d = \frac{1531 \times 2}{2} = 1531 \ m  \) </span>
			<br />
			Depth of water = 1531 m.</p>
