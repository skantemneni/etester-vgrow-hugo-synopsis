	<p>Measurement is the comparison of an unknown quantity with a known standard quantity of same kind. Another important thing is to identify a quantity that can be measured (known as physical quantity). Generally most of the measurements are based on physical quantities like length, mass, time, temperature etc., <br />
		In measuring a physical quantity one needs to have an idea of its various units, their interrelationships and also the various devices used for its measurements.</p>

		<p>In measuring a physical quantity one needs to have an idea of its various units, their interrelationship and also the various devices used for its measurement. <br />
			The unit plays an important role in the description of a physical quantity. But the unit used for a particular physical quantity is person dependant. Hence, they need to be specified and standardized to maintain uniformity. Under this treaty, an International Bureau of weights and measures was established. This Bureau situated at Serves in Paris has specified standard units, measured more accurately with advanced techniques of science. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Measurement of Length </h3>
	<p>Length, a fundamental quantity, is used to measure the distance between two points in space. The SI unit of length is metre (m) and its C.G.S unit is centimetre (cm). The various units used to measure length are p[ m, mm, cm, km. Length can be measured using devices like meter scale, vernier callipers, measuring tape etc., <br />
		Using a ruler we can measure the smallest reading accurately upto 1 mm i.e. Least count of ruler is 1 mm. The length of a rod can be measured using a scale by keeping the scale in contact with the object as shown:</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="104260002_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p> Length of rod = y - x = 2.5 cm - 1 cm = 1.5 cm <br />
		In case of a curved line the length of curved line is found by using a thread ruler method or divider ruler method. </p>

	 </div>
	<p>Similarly, the diameter of a uniform wire is found by winding it over a pencil. The length of wounded wire over pencil is measured by a scale. The measured length of coil is then divided by the number of turns which gives the diameter of wire. <br />
		Diametere of the wire = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{Length \ of \ AB}{Number \ of \ turns}  \) </span>

	<p>Area is a derived quantity, that is obtained by multiplying the two measurements of a regular body. For example the area of a rectangle is calculated as the product of its length and breadth.

	<p>The area of an irregular object can be calculated by drawing the outline of its shape on a graph paper. The number of complete squares are calculated, next the squares greater than half are also counted as a square, leaving the squares less than half. The sum of all the squares gives the area of leaf to be that many <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  cm^2  \) </span>. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Measurement of Mass </h3>
	<p>Mass is the measure of matter contained in a body. Common balance, physical balance are the mostly used devices used for measuring it. SI unit of mass is kilogram. Common balance is used to find unknown mass of an object using known standard masses. <br />
		Weight is the force with which the earth pulls a body towards its centre. The weight of a body is not a constant quantity, but depends upon the acceleration due to gravity acting on the body. The acceleration due to gravity is not same at all the places on the earth, but changes from place to place. <br />
		The weight is generally measured in kilogram - force (kgf) or gram - force (gf) with the help of a spring balance. One kilogram force (kgf) is the force with which the earth attracts a mass of one kilogram. Similarly, one gram force (gf) is the force with which the earth attracts a mass of 1 g. <br />
		The SI unit of weight is newton. The amount of force with which the earth attracts a mass of 1 g. <br />
		The SI unit of weight is newton. The amount of force acting on a body, when the earth pulls a mass 100 g (98.1 g to be exact) is equal to one newton.</p>

	<p>Time is the interval between two events. In our daily life, many events are observed like heart beat, blinking of eyes, appearance of comets etc. These events may be either periodic or may not be periodic. <br />
		In air lines and railways, a 24 hour clock system is used, for example 3 : 25 P.M. in 12 hour clock system is written as 15 hour 25 minutes in 24 hour clock system.</p>

			<br />
			We have Density = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   \frac{Mass}{Volume}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Density of iron is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( 7.8 \ g \ cm^{-3}  \) </span>
			<br />
			In MKS system we have to find the density in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  kg \ cm^{-3}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Thus <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \rho = 7.8 \frac{g}{cm^3} = 7.8 \times \frac{10^{-3} \ kg}{(10^{-2} m)^3} = 7.8 \times \frac{10^{-3}}{10^{-6} m^3} kg  \\\\[3pt]
