	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Water is essential for all living beings, humans, animals, plants. There can be no life without it. All living matter (unicellular or multicellular), plant or animal contain 70% to 90% of water. This water is used by the organism to transport soluble food materials to the cells and for excretion of waste. Water regulates our body temperature. Water is essential for germination of seeds and growth of plant. Water is used for drinking by human beings and animals. It is used for cooking, washing, bathing, cleaning and a number of other activities. Water is used for agriculture and power generations.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Sources of water</h3> 
	<p>People in the village may be getting water from a well or a river whereas in a city we get water in our home through taps where water is supplied by the municipality. Each of us may be getting water into their homes in different ways. But finally all of us get the water from some big source; a river, well or a lake.</p>

	<p>Water as it occurs in nature is called natural water. The various forms of natural water are rain water; river water, water from ponds, lakes, streams and underground water (water from the well)</p>   
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Rain water</h4>  
		<p>It is the purest form of water available in nature. The first showers of rain collects the dust; bacteria, germs and dissolves some of the gases present in the atmosphere. Subsequent showers are free from such impurities.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">River water</h4>  
		<p>Water which flows on the surface of earth making. a regular course is the river water. It is very impure as it contains both suspended and dissolved impurities. It may also contain sewage, chemical and toxic waste flowing into it from a nearby town, village or an industry (The Ganges river flowing near Kanpur city is polluted because of the chemical wastes being	flown into the river from various shoe factories of Kanpur).</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">See water</h4>  
		<p>Rivers ultimately flow into the sea. So all the impurities are carried into the sea. Sea water is very salty and impure form of natural water. Yet the oceans play an import' ant role in supplying the water we get through water cycle.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Spring or well water (ground water)</h4>  
		<p>Rain water falls into rivers and seas. Some of it evaporates and mixes in the air. The rest is absorbed by the ground and is called ground water. The surface of the ground water is called the water table. The level of the water table is not fixed and varies from place to place depending on the condition of soil and amount of rain fall. This water reappears at several places in the form of spring water. Sometimes this water is obtained by digging wells and called well water. Spring or well water is purer than sea or river water but less purer than rain water. It still contains some impurities from earth's crust and needs to be purified before drinking.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Electrolysis of Water</h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Classifications</h5>
		<p>The process of breaking down of a compound by passing electric current through it is called  electrolysis, The electrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen in the ratio of 2 : 1 by volume.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Physical properties of water</h4> 
		<p>Water is a neutral oxide and has no effect on litmus paper. It is a colorless, transparent liquid at room temperature. Pure water is tasteless and odorless. Pure water boils at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  100^{\circ} C  \) </span> and freezes at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0^{\circ} C  \) </span> at sea level, where the atmospheric pressure is the greatest. The boiling point of water decreases if the pressure is lowered and increases if the pressure is raised. The melting point of ice is lowered if the pressure is increased. <br />
			Impurities lower the freezing point and raise the boiling point of water. Water has the minimum volume and maximum density at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  4^{\circ} C  \) </span> because it starts expanding below <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  4^{\circ} C  \) </span>.The specific heat of water is higher than any other liquid. Hence it is used as cooling agent.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Soft water</h4> 
		<p>Contains few or igneous rock sources, such as granite but may also derive from sandstone sources, since such sedimentary rocks are usually low in calcium and magnesium. <br />
			There are water - softening devices that are used in houses, industries to remove the minerals causing hardness. Artificially softened water is beneficial as scales are not formed in the pipes, boiler or hot water cylinder which is due to deposition of calcium carbonates.</p> 
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Temporary hardness</h4> 
		<p>Temporary hardness is caused by combination of calcium ions and bicarbonate ions in the water. Hardness in water is caused by the presence of calcium ions, magnesium ions, or both. As their concentrations increase, water becomes harder. The combined concentration of calcium and magnesium is frequently referred to as total hardness. Hard water containing bicarbonate of calcium and magnesium can be removed on boiling water. The good thing about temporary hardness is that it is easy to remove by boiling or through precipitation with lime (calcium hydroxide). Boiling and adding lime are two of the older methods used to soften water containing temporary hardness.</p>  
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Permanent hardness </h4> 
		<p>Permanent hardness is hardness (mineral content) that cannot be removed by boiling. It is usually caused by the presence of calcium and magnesium sulphates and/or chlorides in the water, which become more soluble as the temperature rises. They can be removed by several methods. One method is treating with washing Soda. <br />

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Solubility of solids</h4>  
		<p>Water is called universal solvent because a large number of substances dissolve in it. Water is an excellent solvent. The solubility of a solute is the amount of it that dissolves in a unit amount of water. The solubility of a solid increases with the temperature. <br />
			When a solution contains as much solute as it can hold, it is called saturated. The solubility of a gas increases with the increase in pressure and decreases with the increase in temperature. <br />
			Water exists in three states - solid, liquid and gas. The continuous cycling of water among its three forms keeps the total amount of water constant. This is known as water cycle.<br />
			The water table goes down if the usage is more than the replenished water-through rains and seepage. Water harvesting is one of the methods of recharging ground water. It is done by constructing pits to which rain water is diverted and deposited. This increases the ground water level. Sewage is liquid waste. The impurities in water are called contaminants. Chemicals used in agriculture, factories and human waste contaminate water. Waste water treatment plants (WWTP) clean water before its disposal by using a series of processes like filtration, sedimentation, skimming, treatment with anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, chlorination, etc. We all must ensure economy in use of water and make all our effort for conservation of water.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Conservation of water</h3> 
	<p>It is very important for all of us to stop waste and conserve water. Careful and economy in use of water will help in conserving water. Water can be conserved in a large scale by a method known as rain water harvesting. This is done by collecting the rain water in huge pits and storing for use later. <br />
		In cities rain water flowing from the roof of houses are collected into a storage tank by pipes. Instead of collecting the rain water in a tank, the pipes can go directly into a pit in the ground. The water then seeps into ground soil and restore the ground water level. You can help in conservation of water by paying attention to the following at your home, school and neighborhood.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Infiltration </span>
						<br />
						The rainwater and water from other sources such as rivers and ponds seeps through the soil and fills the empty spaces and cracks deep below the ground. This process of seeping water into ground is called infiltration. The ground water thus gets recharged by this process.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Aquifer </span>
						<br />
						At places deep below ground, the ground water is stored between layers of hard rock below the water table. This is known as an aquifer. Water in the aquifers can easily be pumped out with tube wells or hand pumps.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Bawris </span>
						<br />
						Bawris was a traditional way of collecting rain water. Small well are dug and the surface near the mouth of the well is cleaned and made sloppy so that rain water can easily flow into the pit. Bawris are still found in village of Rajasthan where rainfall is scanty and there is acute shortage of water.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Drip irrigation </span>
						<br />
						It is a technique of watering plants by making use of narrow tubes which deliver water water at the base of plant. In this method water is used economically. The loss of er due to evaporation and infiltration is minimized.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Aeration</span>
						<br />
						In the process of water supply in big cities, the water from sedimentation tank is subjeeto4 to combined action of sunlight and air. This kills micro organisms and improves the taste of water.</p>

				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Chlorination </span>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>A part of the dissolved salts precipitate and settle at the bottom of ocean.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>A part of the dissolved salts are consumed by the sea animals and plants. For example, sea shells consume large amount of calcium and magnesium salts. Human being extract common salt for cooking.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Thus, on the whole concentration of salts in sea water remains constant. </p>

			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Clean water is necessary for good health. Some of the preventive measures to stop pollution of water sources are:</p>	
		<div class="list1-ol default-spaced-indented list-numbered-style-lower-roman">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Industrial wastes should be properly treated before allowed to flow into rivers or lakes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>There should not be any accumulation of garbage or excreta near any source of water. This is to avoid any chance of the garbage flowing into the river. Dead bodies of humans and animals should not be thrown into rivers. Bathing and washing of clothes in ponds or rivers should be prohibited.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The water of rivers and lakes should be purified from time to time. Such a project in a large scale should be undertaken by government. The Ganga purification project is as example.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>chemical fertilizers and pesticides which decay on their or get decomposed by raj should be used on plants, so their harmful effects will be minimum.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Use of bio degradable substances should be encouraged and non - bio degradable like  plastic, polythene should be banned.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Water from all sources must be purified by chemical process before supplied for drinking.</p>

		<p>Suggest methods for conservation of water :</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			One of the most important steps in conservation of water is to prevent wastage of precious water. Small effort to prevent wastages like leaking of water, spilling of water will help in water conservation. Some of the other methods are: </p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Rain water harvesting : </span>
						<br />
						By making pits near buildings where rain water can be made to flow to recharge the ground water.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Drip irrigation : </span>
						<br />
						It is a technique by which plants are watered directly at their base reducing wastage of water.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Recycling of waste water : </span>
						<br />
						Waste water can be chemically treated for reuse. If it is not for drinking it can be used for washing clothes and watering plants.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Cleaning existing water reservoirs :</span>
						<br />
						De-setting of lakes, ponds and cleaning of rivers will help in recharging the ground water.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Afforestation :</span>
						<br />
						Planting of trees help in increase of rain fall and prevents soil erosion there by recharging ground water.</p>
