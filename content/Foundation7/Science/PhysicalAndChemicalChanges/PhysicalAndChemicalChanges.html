	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Every substance in this universe undergoes some change or the other. These changes can be classified be either slow or fast, reversible or irreversible, periodic or non periodic, desirable or undesirable, physical or chemical changes. All changes can be broadly classified into physical and chemical changes.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="02">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Physical change</h3>
	<p>Properties like shape, size, colour and state of a substance are called physical properties and any changes in these properties of a substance are called physical changes.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Consider the following examples:</h4>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Press the switch of an electric bulb. The bulb glows and gives out light and heat. Now switch it off. The bulb stops glowing. After sometime, if you touch the bulb it is no longer hot.</p>
					<div class="synopsis-image"> 
						<img src="104260008_image-1.png" alt="image-1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
					 </div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Take some water in a beaker and add a teaspoon of salt to it and stir well. The salt dissolves completely. Taste the solution. It will have a salty taste. Now heat the solution, until all water evaporates. A white substance, salt will be left behind in the beaker.</p>
					<div class="synopsis-image"> 
						<img src="104260008_image-2.png" alt="image-2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
					 </div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>The changes that take place in these examples are:</p>	  
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>	  
				<li>
					<p>No new substance is formed.</p>
				</li>	  
				<li>
					<p>The change is temporary and reversible.</p>
				</li>	  
				<li>
					<p>In both cases, the change affects only the physical properties of the substance.</p>
				</li>	  
			</ol>
		</div>	  
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>	  
				<li>
					<p>In example: It can be implied that, the filament of the bulb conducts electricity, gets heated up and emits light. When cooled it gets back the old colour. It again conducts when switched ON.</p>
				</li>	  
				<li>
					<p>In example : It can be implied that, the salt dissolves in water and undergoes a change in its physical state without losing its characteristic. When water gets evaporated, we get back the same salt with same salty taste.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>	  
		<p>Let us study some more examples :</p>	  
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>	  
				<li>
					<p>breaking of a bone china plate.</p>
				</li>  
				<li>
					<p>use of a chalk to write on the black board.</p>
				</li>  
			</ol>
		</div> 
		<p>The above two are also examples of physical change where:</p>  
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>	  
				<li>
					<p>upon breaking a bone china plate, the small pieces cannot be joined to get the original plate, though the pieces are made up of the same substance. No new substance has been formed.</p>
				</li> 
				<li>
					<p>As the chalk piece gets used it gets only smaller in size, but the contents of chalk in hand and on the black board are same. No new substance formed here also.</p>
				</li>  
			</ol>
		</div> 
		<p>These kind of changes are also physical but NOT reversible. Therefore:<br />
			A physical change is a temporary change in which no new substance is formed and the composition of the substance is not altered, although certain specific physical properties like shape or size may be changed.</p>

	<p>Rusting of iron is a chemical change which can be prevented by depositing a layer of zinc on iron. This process is called galvanization. Water pipes are galvanised to prevent rusting. Stainless steel is made by mixing iron with carbon and metals like chromium, nickel and manganese. It does not rust. The formation of large crystals of pure substance from their solutions is called crystallization. It is a physical change.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 1:</h4>
		<p>Change of state from ice to water and to steam has been shown below. What kind of change is this ?<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Ice  \underset{cooling}{\overset{heating}{\rightleftharpoons}}  water \underset{cooling}{\overset{heating}{\rightleftharpoons}} steam \) </span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			In the above example, ice on heating melts into water and water on heating changes into steam. Conversely on cooling steam converts to water and water into ice. Thus, it is a physical and reversible change.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="solved-example">
		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
		<p>Which of the following changes are physical and reversible ?</p> 
		<div class="list1-ol default-spaced-indented list-numbered-style-lower-roman">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Magnetisation of an iron bar.</p>

				<li>
					<p>Melting of ice.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			If we magnetise an iron bar, it undergoes magnetisation. On demagnetisation it loses it magnetism, similarly in water cycle, the evaporated water comes back to earth as rain water. If you cool the vapour of the sublimated substance you'll get back the solid. And ice, when melted forms water and on cooling can gets back its original shape.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 3:</h4>
		<p>Is pasteurisation of milk a physical or chemical change?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Milk gets spoiled over a period of time due to harmful bacteria. It is preserved by a method known as pasteurisation where milk is boiled for 15 minutes at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  72^{\circ}C  \) </span> and then cooled. This process kills harmful bacteria. However in this change, no new substance is formed and milk retains its original properties.It is a physical but irreversible change.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 4:</h4>
		<p>When we add sugar to water, it gets dissolved and we cannot see sugar grains. What change takes place?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The sugar grains change its form when it is dissolved in water. However no new substance is formed. The sugar remains as sugar and water remains as water you can get back the two components of the mixture by allowing the water to evaporate and then condensing the vapour. Sugar or salt will dissolve faster in hot water as compared to cold water. Stirring helps them to dissolve faster.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 5:</h4>
		<p>Determination of the conditions necessary for rusting of iron based on the figure given below.Also suggest the ways to prevent rusting?</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104260008_image-6.png" alt="image-6" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			When iron and steel are exposed to damp air, they interact with oxygen and water vapour in the air to form rust. The experiment carried out as shown in figure shows that air and water is necessary for rusting. You will observe that after a few days water rises up the tube because oxygen is used up. To show that air is necessary for rusting we can conduct <br />
			<span class="highlight01">  a small experiment. </span>
		</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104260008_image-7.png" alt="image-7" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>Boil water. Pour oil so that it forms a layer over water. Now put some iron nails into the pot. Wait for few days. The iron nails do not rust. Boiled water when cooled has little air. The oil layer prevents air from getting into the water. The iron nails do not rust because there is no enough oxygen.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Ways to prevent Rusting:</span>
			<br />
			Only things made of iron and steel will rust. We can prevent them from rusting by painting, oiling or greasing them. Paint, oil, grease are water proof materials. They prevent the iron and steel coming into contact with water. In some cases iron and steel sheets are coated with a thin layer of tin or chromium. They act as a protective coating.</p>

		 </div>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Take a beaker and fill it with water. To this add quicklime, a white powder (CaO). You p. will notice that, the moment quicklime comes in contact with water the mixture gets heated up. This can be felt by touching the beaker by hand. A new substance, slaked lime is formed and heat is liberated. This is a chemical change. </p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 7: </h4>
		<p>What inference can you draw from the activity explained in Q No.6?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			For a change to occur, interaction between substances is essential along with energy change. Broadly speaking there are two kinds of heat changes, exothermic and endothermic. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Exothermic:</span>
			<br /> 
			Changes are those which gives out heat for example, burning of wood, glowing of an electric lamp, dissolution of sodium hydroxide flakes in water, bursting of cracker etc., <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Endothermic:</span>
			<br /> 
			Changes are those during which heat is absorbed. For example melting of ice, cooking of food, drying of wet clothes, dissolution of ammonium chloride in water etc., These changes can occur only if the substance gets heat from outside.</p>

	<section class="solved-example">
		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 8: </h4>
		<p>Give example of an activity where both physical and chemical change take place? What type of energy conversion takes place in such activity?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			When a candle burns, the wax melts and the wick burns. The melting of wax is a physical change while the burning is a chemical change. The chemical energy of candle gets converted to heat and light energy.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Note:</span>
			<br />
			The remnants of melted wax can be obtained back by cooling but the burnt portion can't be obtained back.</p>

		<p>Which of the following is NOT a chemical change?</p>
		<div class="list1-ol default-spaced-indented list-numbered-style-lower-roman">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Photosynthesis</p>

					<p>Production of biogas from animal waste.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The liquified petroleum gas is in liquid state because of high pressure. On opening the cylinder valve, the pressure releases and gas comes out. However if this gas is collected and pressurised, we will get back LPG. <br />
			All other cases a, b and d are chemical changes, since new products are formed. </p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 10: </h4>
		<p>When you spray perfume on your body why do you feel cool? Why does the perfume droplets vanish?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The perfume droplets get heat from the body through skin and change to vapour. The skin feels cool because it loses heat to vaporise the perfume droplets. The drying up (or vaporisation) of the perfume is an endothermic reaction.</p>
