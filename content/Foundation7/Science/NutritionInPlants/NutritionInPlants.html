	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Nutrition is the mode of intake of food by the organism and its utilisation by the body. All organisms need food to perform their life processes. Food comprises of different nutrients which include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals. Food provides us energy to grow, repair the damaged parts in our body. Living organisms include microorganisms, plants and animals. <br />
		Plants obtain their nutrition by various modes. The mode of nutrition in plants can be autotrophic mode or heterotrophic mode. Plants can be classified into autotrophs and heterotrophs.</p>

			<li>
				<p>Autotrophic plants can synthesise their own food by the process of photosynthesis. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Heterotrophic plants cannot synthesise food on their own but depend on other organisms for their nutrition. Heterotrophic plants can be further classified into parasites, saprophytes and symbiotic plants. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Autotrophic mode of nutrition - Photosynthesis</h4>  
		<p>It is an autotrophic mode of nutrition. Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants can synthesise glucose from raw materials like carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll. Photosynthesis involves the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy to synthesise starch.<br />

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Plants absorb carbon dioxide from air and water from the soil which are used as raw materials.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The green plagment chlorophyll present in the leaves absorbs energy from sunlight to carry out the synthesise of food. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Plants by the process of photosynthesis can produce glucose as food. Oxygen is released as by-product in this process.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Facts about photosynthesis</h4>
		<p>All chlorophyll-containing plants, including algae, and some plants with red, brown or other dominant pigments, make their food by photosynthesis.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Leaves are considered as food factories of a plant.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil and are transported to different parts of the plant.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Stomata present in the lower epidermis of the leaf take in carbon dioxide from the air.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Leaves have special structures called as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts possess chlorophyll, a green colour pigment present in the leaf captures energy from sunlight. Sun is the ultimate source of sunlight for all the living organisms on earth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Plants synthesise glucose using carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Oxygen and water are released as by-products through the stomata during daytime.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The food synthesised is transported to other parts of the plant for utilisation and storage.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Glucose is a carbohydrate. Glucose synthesised by the process of photosynthesis is converted into complex compounds like starch and cellulose. Starch is stored in different parts of the plant.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Plants also prepare proteins with the help of nitrogen which is obtained from the soil.  </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Thus, the minerals dissolved in water are used to convert sugar synthesised into carbohydrates, proteins and fats.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>These food components stored are the source of energy for other heterotrophic plants and animals.</p>
				</li>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Heterotrophic mode of nutrition</h4>
		<p>Heterotrophic plants do not possess chlorophyll. Therefore, they cannot produce their own food using the process of photosynthesis. Heterotrophic plants obtain food from other plants by following either a parasitic, saprophytic or symbiotic mode.</p>

		 </div>		 
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Parasitic mode:</h5>
		<p>The organisms which exhibit parasitic mode of nutrition are called as parasites. Parasites obtain their nourishment from other living organisms. In parasitic mode of nutrition, plants depend on other plants or animals for their nourishment. Such plants are called as parasites and the ones on which parasites depend are called as hosts. </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>e.g.Mistletoe is another parasitic plant which depends on other organisms for its nourishment.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>e.g.Cuscuta is a parasitic plant which develops special roots called haustoria. Haustoria penetrate deep into host plant tissues and just absorb the nutrients from them.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Insectivorous mode:</h5>
		<p>These are the plants with special leaves that are modified into special structures. These structures have the ability to trap the organisms.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>e.g. Nepenthes is otherwise called as pitcher plant has its leaves modified into pitchers closed with leaves. These have a network of fibres which entangle the trapped organism and later digest it by secreting some hydrolysing enzymes to digest them.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>e.g. Venus fly trap feeds on small animals and insects to obtain their nourishment. These plants especially obtain the nitrogen they require from insects and small animals.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Saprophytic mode:</h5> 
		<p>The plants which exhibit saprotrophic mode of nutrition are called as saprotrophs. Saprotrophs are the plants that obtain their nutrition from dead and decaying organic matter. Saprotrophs secrete digestive juices onto dead and decaying matter to dissolve it and then absorb nutrients from it.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>e.g. Indian pipe which is found on dead and rotting material, inhabits fungus in its roots. These extend their mycelium and secrete enzymes to digest the decaying matter.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>e.g. Coral roots are another type of plants exhibiting saprophytic nutrition.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Symbiotic mode:</h5> 
		<p>Symbiosis is the phenomenon by which two organisms maintain relationship with each other to be mutually benefitted. In symbiotic mode, organisms develop a special relationship with certain other organisms to obtain nourishment. Organisms involved in this type of relationship are called as symbionts.</p>			
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>e.g. Rhizobium bacteria and Leguminous plants are symbionts exhibiting symbiosis. Plants cannot utilise atmospheric nitrogen directly. Hence, leguminous plants establish a symbiotic relationship with bacteria like Rhizobium. Both the organisms of symbiotic relationship are mutually benefited. Leguminous plant provides shelter and nourishment for the bacteria and in turn bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen to the plant.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>e.g. Digestion in ruminants is a good example of symbiosis. A large sac-like structure called the caecum lies between the small and large intestines. The symbiotic bacteria present in the caecum help in complete digestion of cellulose. Microorganisms present in the stomach of ruminants help in digesting cellulose and in turn obtain shelter and nourishment form the animal. A symbiotic relationship exists between microorganisms and the ruminants. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>e.g. Lichens form a very good example of symbiotic relationship. Lichens are formed by the symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi sharing a single colony. Fungus provides water, nutrients and shelter in the form of network formed by mycelium. Algae synthesises the food for entire colony by the process of photosynthesis.  </p>
