	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Heat is a form of energy which produces a sensation in our body by way of which we make out whether a body is cold, warm or hot. Hence it has the ability to do work. For example, the steam engine pulls a train converting heat into mechanical energy. Heat can also be converted to other forms of energy. For example, the heat in a fire cracker produces both sound and light.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Heat energy brings about change in temperature conversely, if a hot body gives out heat energy, its temperature falls.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Heat energy brings about change in dimensions when a material body is heated,its length, area and volume increases.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Heat energy brings about change in state. When heat supplied to the solid, at a particular constant temperature it changes into the liquid state. Similarly liquid changes into gaseous state. During the change of state, the temperature of the body remains constant.</p>

				<p>Heat energy affects the living things.</p>

	<p>Sun is the Earth's main source of heat energy. Other sources of heat include burning of fuels, eg., wood, coal, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), rubbing of two surfaces against each other, or from electricity. Heat always flows from a body of higher temperature to the body at lower temperature</p>

		<p>The device used for measuring the temperature of a substance is called Thermometer. <br />
			("Thermo" is a latin word which means heat and "matter" means a measuring device). Thermometer works on the principle that <span class="highlight01">matter expand </span> when heated and contract when cooled. There are different thermometric substances like mercury, alcohol etc., used in thermometers for different range of temperatures to be measured. Mercury is used in thermometers as thermometric substance because of the following advantages.</p>

		<p>The calibration of thermometer involves fixing of two points on it one lower fixed point (L.F.P) and other upper fixed point (U.F.P). <br />
			The melting point of pure ice at normal atmospheric pressure is taken as lower fixed point (L.F.P). The boiling point of pure water at normal atmospheric pressure is taken as upper fixed point (U.F.P). The constant temperature at which, the solid substance changes into liquid is called its melting point. The constant temperature at which, a liquid changes into gaseous state is called boiling point.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Transmission of Heat</h3> 
	<p>" The phenomenon of transfer of heat from a hotter body to a colder body is called transfer of heat". There are three modes of transfer of heat</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Conduction</h4> 
		<p>The process of transmission of heat in solids without the actual movement of particles from their positions, is called conduction of heat. A medium is required for the transfer of heat by conduction. Therefore conduction is not possible in vacuum. In solids heat is transferred mainly by the process of conduction. Heat can be conducted from one body to another only if they are </p>

			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>The substances which allow the heat energy to flow through them easily, are called good conductors of heat or simply conductors. All metals are good conductors of heat. Silver is the best, copper is next, followed by aluminium, iron and lead. <br />
			The substances, which do not allow the heat energy to flow through them easily are called bad conductors of heat or heat insulators. Substances such as glass, wood, cloth, air, pure water, wax, paper, clay etc., are the bad conductors of heat. Liquids (except mercury) are usually the poor conductors of heat. Gases are still poorer conductors of heat as compared to liquids. Ebonite and asbestos are the worst conductors of heat.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Convection</h4> 
		<p>Convection is the mode of heat transfer in liquids and gases taking place by the actual movement of molecules from one part to another. A medium is required for the transfer of heat by convection. Heat cannot be transferred is always vertically upwards.By the process of convection, the heat transmission is always vertically upwards. <br />

		 </div>

			Heat does not pass through a bad conductor/insulator. Paper is a bad conductor of heat. Thus the heat, due to burning at one end will not pass to the other end, held by the boy.

			A cooking pot is made of metal because metals are good conductors of heat and heat is needed to cook the food. Heat does not pass through bad conductors of heat.

			<br />
			When a body is heated, the heat energy increases the motion of the molecules in the body. The movement of molecules tend to increase the volume of the matter when heated. This is a result of expansion of things. Gases expand more than liquids (since molecules are relatively free). Liquids expand more than solids when heated.</p>
