	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>About 97% of the Universe (by mass) is made up of hydrogen and helium. The next most common elements are oxygen, iron, nitrogen and carbon. The most abundant metal in the Earth's crust is aluminium, followed by iron, calcium, sodium and magnesium. Less common metals like copper, silver, gold and uranium are concentrated in areas which allow them to be profitably mined. Most metals occur in combination with other elements as ores. Unreactive metals like silver, gold and platinum exist in the free or native form. Sometimes, iron and copper also occur naturally in their elemental state. Metallurgy is the chemistry that deals with the extracting metals from their ores.

			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Froth Flotation Process</h5>
		<p> The different wetting characteristics of the ore particles and gangue with oil and water are used. The ore slurry is mixed with a froth (usually pine oil) and a collector (usually ethyl xanthate) in a large tank. The collector makes the ore particles water repeE. The whole mixture is agitated with air. The oil coated ore, being lighter than the water coated impurities, forms a froth and rises to the surface of the tank. It is then skimmed off. The impurities cling to the water and settle down.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Electromagnetic Separation</h5>
		<p> Magnetic properties of the ores are used in this process. The powdered ore is placed on a leather conveyor belt which passes over two rollers, one of which is magnetic. As the magnetic ore particles come over the roller, they are attracted by it and fall down. The nonmagnetic impurities form a separate pile at a distance due to the high speed of the moving belt.</p>

			The fused electrolyte is taken in an iron taken lined with gas carbon which acts cathode. A number or parallel carbon rods dipped in the electrolyte act as anode. In order to prevent the loss of heat and burning of carbon electrodes, the electrolyte is covered with coke. <br />

On top, it has a double cup and cone arrangement. Below this, there is an outlet for waste gases. A hearth is present at the bottom to collect cast iron and slag, and has separate outlets for each. The compressed air is blown into the furnace through pipes called tyres which are placed above the hearth. The ore is mixed with coke, and limestone approximately in the ratio of 8 : 4 : 1. This mixture is called charge. The charge is lowered into the furnace from the top through the cup and cone arrangement and various reactions take place in the furnace at different levels. </p>

			At such a high temperature, the limestone added decomposes to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. <br />

Iron being heavier forms the bottom layer with slag on top. From here iron and slag are tapped through separate outlets. Iron thus obtained in called pig iron. Solid pig iron is remelted in a vertical furnace known as cupola and thereby gets refined. Then it is poured into suitable moulds of required shape. This remelted pig iron is called cast iron.</p>

It is the refined form of cast iron. It is prepared by heating cast iron in a  reverberatory furnace. The furnace is lined internally with iron oxide. This oxidises carbon in the cast iron to gaseous oxides of carbon. The other impurities are slagged of using lime as flux.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Conversion of Cast Iron to Steel </h4>

Small amounts of carbon and other metals like chromium, manganese, vanadium, nickel are added to iron to impart special properties required for a variety of   uses. The carbon content of steel varies from 0.1% to 1.5% depending on its use. Cast iron is converted to steel by Bessemer process. This process is carried out in a Bessemer convertor. </p>

			<br />
			Aluminium is extracted from its ore by electrolytic reduction. Iron is extracted from its ore by chemical reduction.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The position of aluminium is above that of carbon in the reactivity series. Carbon is not able to reduce aluminium oxide to aluminium. Therefore, aluminium is extracted by electrolysis of its molten oxide. Aluminium ion is reduced at the cathode: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( Al^{3+} (l) + 3e^- \rightarrow Al(l)  \) </span>

			<span class="highlight01">Question:</span>
			<br />
			Pure iron is soft, making it malleable and ductile. Steel is hard and tough, making it difficult to mould. Explain.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The atoms in pure iron are closely packed and arranged in an orderly manner. This enables the layers of atoms to slide easily over one another. Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon together with some other metals. The presence of foreign atoms disrupts the orderly arrangement. This prevents the layers of atoms from sliding over one another.

			<span class="highlight01">Question:</span>
			<br />
			Iron is not found naturally in the form of the free metal. Gold can be found naturally as the free metal. Explain.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Iron is much higher than gold in the reactivity series. Hence, iron is much more reactive than gold. Iron will react readily with other elements like oxygen to form compounds. Being at the bottom of the reactivity series indicates that gold is unreactive. Gold does not react readily with other elements to form compounds.
