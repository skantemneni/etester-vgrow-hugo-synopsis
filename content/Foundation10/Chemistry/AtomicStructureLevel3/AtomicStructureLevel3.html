	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Discovery of fundamental particles lead to the study of pattern of arrangement of these particles inside the atom. Various atomic models visualizing various patterns of arrangement have been proposed by different scientists such as Thomson, Rutherford, Niels Bohr etc.,

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Atomic Models</h3>
	<p>Many attempts were made to propose various atomic models to describe the position of the fundamental particles in the atom.

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">J.J. Thomson's atomic model</h4>
		<p>J.J. Thomson proposed the atomic model (the discoverer of electrons) in 1898. According to him an atom is considered as a sphere of positive charge in which negatively charged particles (electrons) are embedded uniformly to neutralise that positive charge.

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Rutherford's atomic model</h4>
		<p>Rutherford performed the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \alpha  \) </span> - ray scattering to know about the position of fundamental particles (to test J.J. Thomson's atomic model). <br />
			In his experiment he observed that most of the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \alpha  \) </span> particles passed through the gold foil without any deflection from the path, few <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \alpha  \) </span> particles were deflected by small angles. One in 10,000 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \alpha  \) </span> particles bounded back in the same direction. On the basis of the above observations, Rutherford drew the following conclusions.

				<li>
					<p>Atom consists of predominately empty space. </p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Electrons revolve at high speed in the extra nuclear space around the nucleus in circular orbits like the planets revolve around the sun. The model of an atom is popularly known as planetary model. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>As per the law of electrodynamics of classical mechanics, the charged particles like electron moving around the opposite charge in circular motion should continuously lose energy by emission and spiral down into the nucleus. If this happens atom should collapse, which is not happening. If the electron in an atom continuously radiates energy, the spectrum of an element should be a continuous spectrum, But the atoms give rise to discontinuous line spectra.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Bohr's atomic theory</h4>
		<p>Among the various models proposed, Bohr's model of atom has been proved with some experimental evidences. Bohr's theory was mainly based on Planck's quantum theory. According to this, emission or absorption of energy is always in the form of packets called quanta. Each quantum carries an energy equal to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  E = h \nu  \) </span> where h is called Planck's constant (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( h = 6.625 \times 10^{-34}  \) </span>joule - s and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \nu  \) </span> is frequency of radiation). Niels Bohr's atomic model was based on Planck's quantum theory retaining Rutherford's nuclear model. <br />
			The main postulates of this model are:</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p> Electrons revolve around the nucleus in specified circular paths with definite amount of energy called stationary orbits or stationary shells. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>These are also called energy levels and are designated as K, L, M, N corresponding to 1,2,3,4 respectively. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The energy associated with a certain energy level increases with the increase of its distance from the nucleus. Hence, if the energy associated with the K, L, M, N shells are <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( E_1, \ E_2, \ E_3	  \) </span>respectively, then <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( E_1 &lt; E_2 &lt; E_3  \) </span> , etc., </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>An electron jumps from a lower energy level to a higher energy level by absorbing energy. But when it jumps from a higher to lower energy level, energy is emitted in the form of electromagnetic radiations. The energy emitted or absorbed <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( ( \Delta E)  \) </span> is an integral multiple of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  h \nu  \) </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The electron can revolve only in the orbit in which the angular momentum of the electron (mvr) is quantised, i.e, mvr is a whole number multiple of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{h}{2 \pi}  \) </span>  This is known as principle of quantization of angular momentum.  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \left ( mvr = \frac{nh}{2 \pi} \right )  \) </span>. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">De Broglie's theory</h4>
		<p>Louis de Broglie pointed out that the wave behaviour of an electron is similar to that of a standing wave. The circumference of each Bohr's orbit must be equal to an integral multiple of the wave length of the wave associated with the moving electron. Orbits whose circumferences are not equal to the integral multiple of the wave length are impossible for an electron in Bohr's atom.<br />
			The expression is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \lambda = \frac{h}{momentum \ of \ electron}  \) </span>. <br/>
			or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \lambda = \frac{h}{mv}  \) </span>
			<br />
			where m = mass of electron. <br />
			v = velocity of electrons. <br />
			h = planck's constant. <br />
			This equation is called de Broglie's equation, this hypothesis was experimentally confirmed by Davison and Germer who proved wave like properties of electron in 1927. <br />
			During this period on the basis of the wave properties of electrons, Austrian Physicist Erwing Schrondinger derived an equation called Schrondinger wave equation to describe the behaviour and energies of electrons in an atom.<br />
			Based on this wave equation, the three dimensional region in space around the nucleus, where the probability of finding an electron with a particular energy is determined to be maximum, is called the atomic orbital.<br />
			On the basis of Schrodinger wave equation a quantum mechanical model of atom has been proposed. In this model, the state of an electron in an atom can be explained with respect to four quantum numbers.
