	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>In nature, most of the elements exist in combined state in the form of molecules. Only in some cases like inert gases, atom exists independently. The reason for these elements to have independent existence is due to high stability because of completely filled octet or duplet configuration. This is the reason the atoms of other elements have tendency to attain. Stability by combining with same or other elements the above stable configuration by means of bond formation. The process of bond formation resulting in various types of bonds depending on the nature of participant atoms is known as chemical bonding.</p>
	<section class="subheading">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Types of bonds</h4>
		<p>The various types of bonds are:</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Ionic bond (or) electrovalent bond</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Covalent bond</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Coordinate bond (or) dative bond</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Metallic bond</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>All these four bonds are called strong bonds. These are attractive interactions between the atoms or molecules which are comparatively weaker than the bonds mentioned above. They are called weaker bonds. Hydrogen bond and vanderwaals forces of interactions are examples of weaker bonds.</p>
	</section>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="02">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Ionic bond or Electrovalent bond</h3>
	<p>An ionic bond is defined as the electrostatic attractive force that exists between two oppositely charged ions in a molecule.<br />
		The compounds whose ions are held together by ionic or electrovalent bonds are called ionic or electrovalent compounds. These are the compounds which are formed by the complete transfer of one or more electrons from an electropositive element (usually a metallic element) to an electronegative element (usually a nonmetallic element). Generally an ionic bond is formed between a metal and a nonmetal.</p>
	<section class="subheading">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Electrovalency</h4>
		<p>The number of electrons lost or gained from the valence shell of an atom of an element to form an ion having the stable electron octet of the nearest inert gas is called its electrovalency. For example, calcium (2, 8, 8, 2) loses the two electrons in the valence shell (last shell) to form <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Ca^{2+}  \) </span> (2, 8, 8) the stable electronic configuration of the nearest inert gas, argon. Hence electrovalency of calcium is + 2. Chlorine (2, 8, 7) gains one electron to form <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Cl^{-}  \) </span> (2, 8, 8), the stable configuration of the nearest inert gas, argon. Thus, the electrovalency of chlorine is - 1.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subheading">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Covalent bond</h4>
		<p>A covalent bond is defined as the bond formed by the sharing of one or more electron pair(s) between the two combining atoms in such a way that both can attain the stable electronic configuration of the nearest inert gas. The two combining atoms may be smilar or dissimilar nonmetallic atoms. The difference between the electronegativities of the combining atoms should be either zero or very small. Compounds formed by the sharing of electron pairs are called covalent or molecular compounds.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subheading">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Non polar covalent bond</h4>
		<p>In a bond between two identical atoms the electrons are shared equally between the atoms. No separation of charge takes place in the molecule. This type of bond is called nonpolar  covalent bond.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Covalency</h4>
		<p>In a bond between two identical atoms the electrons are shared equally between the atoms. No separation of charge takes place in the molecule. This type of bond is called nonpolar  covalent bond.</p> 
	</section>
	<section class="subheading"> 
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Types of covalent bonds</h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Single covalent bond</h5>
		<p>A covalent bond formed by the mutual sharing of only one pair of electrons by the two combining atoms is called a single covalent bond. It is also known as a single bond. This single bond is denoted by a single line,_______, between the two atoms. Each atom contributes one electron for sharing.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Double covalent bond</h5>
		<p>If two electron pairs are shared by the two combining atoms, it is called a double covalent bond. also called a double bond. This bond is indicated by two parallel lines, = , between the two combining atoms. Each combining atom contributes two electrons for sharing.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Triple covalent bond</h5>
		<p>A triple covalent bond is formed by the mutual sharing of three electron pairs between the two combining atoms. This bond is denoted by three parallel lines, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \equiv  \) </span> between the two atoms. It is also called a triple bond. Three electrons are contributed by each of the two combining atoms.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Polar covalent bond</h5>
		<p>When a covalent bond is formed between two dissimilar atoms or atoms having different electronegativities, then the shared pair (s) of electrons will be attracted more towards the more electronegative atom than towards the other. As a result, the more electronegative atom develops a small negative charge (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \delta^{-}  \) </span>) and the less electronegative atom develops a small positive charge (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \delta^{+}  \) </span>), due to the presence of these two charges the covalent bond between the dissimilar atoms having slightly different electronegativities is said to get some ionic or polar characters. Such a covalent bond is called polar covalent bond. Examples of polar covalent molecules are <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  HCl, \ H_2O, \ NH_2, \ HF, \ HBr, \ HI  \) </span> etc.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Note</span>

			Polar covalent compounds are covalent when pure but became ionic when dissolved in water.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Valence bond theory and its Postulates</h3>
	<p>Lewis theory failed to explain the bond angles and the shape of the molecules, So a theory which could explain these factors was needed. Schordinger's work laid the formation in the direction. He was the one, who introduced the concept of "wave mechanics". A moving electron, is said to behave as both, a particle and a wave. Wave mechanics, deals with the behaviour of an electron as a wave. Schrodinger, with the help of wave mechanics proposed the shape of orbitals. This development led to the concept of orbital bonding in the form of valence bond theory. This valence bond theory, was developed by Heitler and London in 1927, based on wave mechanics. Later, Pauling and Slater modified this theory.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Cause for the formation of a covalent bond:</span>
					A covalent bond is formed by the overlap of orbitals of one atom, with orbitals of another atom.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Conditions for overlapping of orbitals:</span>
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Only an orbital with unpaired electrons is eligible for overlapping.<br />
							Eg: Outer electronic configuration of 'Cl' and its block diagram is</p>
						<div class="synopsis-image"> 
							<img src="104490004_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
						 </div>
						<p>In the outer shell of Cl, the orbitals <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3s, \ 3p_x  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3p_y  \) </span> are completely filled with one pair of electrons in each, whereas 3pz orbital is half-filled and it is said to be an orbital with an unpaired electron. Only such an orbital is eligible for overlapping.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>For the orbitals to overlap, the electrons in overlapping orbitals should spin in the opposite direction.</p>
						<div class="synopsis-image"> 
							<img src="104490004_image-2.png" alt="image2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
						 </div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>After overlapping, the shape of the orbitals change such that a greater electron density appear between the nuclei of the atoms, along the internuclear axis (an imaginary line joining the nuclei of combining atoms)<br />
							E.g. During the overlap of two 'p' orbitals, the size of one lobe decreases and the other lobe stretches and increases in size. The lobes with an increased size, merge with each other resulting in greater electron density, along the internuclear axis.</p>
						<div class="synopsis-image"> 
							<img src="104490004_image-3.png" alt="image3" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
						 </div>
						<p>A region of high electron density is formed between the nuclei of the combining atoms. The attraction between the positive nuclei and the electron cloud, in the region of high electron density holds the combining atoms together.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The direction of the covalent bond is in that direction in which, the overlapping orbitals have greater electron density. This is along the internuclear axis.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Strength of covalent bond:</span>
					<br />
					The factor which decides the strength of a covalent bond is the extent of the overlap. Greater the extent of the overlap, more is the strength of a covalent bond. The extent of the overlap depends on the shape of the orbitals. The spherical 's' orbitals cannot overlap effectively, whereas the extent of overlap in the dumbbell shaped 'p' orbitals is more. So, covalent bonds involving the overlap of 's' orbitals are weaker, when compared to covalent bonds involving the overlap of `p' orbitals.</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The two atoms in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  O_2  \) </span> molecule, should have close electronic shell, resembling those of Ne, which would give even number of electrons (paired) to the molecule, which will make a diamagnetic (substances which get repelled in a magnetic field.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Shapes of Molecules</h4>
		<p>A theory called VSEPR (<i>Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion</i>) helps in explaining the shapes of simple covalent molecules. A bond pair means 2 electrons involved in bonding. A lone pair means a pair of 2 electrons not involved in bonding. They are lonely and single. Electron pairs consist of bond pairs and lone pairs. According to this theory, the carious electron pairs around a central atom orient themselves in such a way that there is minimum repulsion between them and maximum stability. The decreasing order of repulsions among electron pairs is as under.<br />
			lane pair - lone pair > lone pair - bond pair > bond pair - bond pair<br />

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Coordinate covalent bond</h4>
		<p>It is a special type of covalent bond in which only one of the participating atoms contributes the electron pair for sharing. The atom which gives the electron pair for sharing is called the donor and the other atom which accommodates the shared pair of electrons is called an acceptor. In this mechanism, the contribution of electron pair is one-sided, and slight polarity develops in the molecule. A coordinate bond is represented by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \rightarrow  \) </span> pointing from the donor atom to the acceptor atom. A coordinate bond is explained below with the help of some examples.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Metallic bond</h4>
		<p>Each atom in a metal crystal loses all its valence electrons. The electrons thus obtained from an electron pool. The resulting positively charged metal ions are believed to be held together by the electron pool. The positively charged metal ions have a definite position in the crystal lattice of the metal. The valence electrons are not attached to any individual ions, they belong to the crystal as a whole and are free to move throughout the metal crystal. The electrostatic force of attraction that binds metal ions to the mobile electrons within its sphere of influence is known as a metallic bond.</p>

			<span class="highlight01">Question:</span>
			<br />
			The overlapping orbitals always possess electrons with opposite spin. Give reason.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			If the overlapping orbitals have electrons with same spin, the increased repulsive forces between the electrons oriented in the same direction increases energy of the system and decreases stability. Hence overlapping orbitals always need to possess electrons with opposite spin.</p>

			<span class="highlight01">Question:</span>
			<br />
			Compare the solubilities of various lithium halides in water.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Lattice energy of these halides decreases from LiF to LiI with increase in size of the anion. Hydration energy increases from LiF to LiI. The greater difference between hydration energy and lattice energy, the greater will be the solubility. Thus LiF is insoluble and LiI is soluble.</p>

			<span class="highlight01">Question:</span>
			<br />
			Among hybrid orbitals and pure orbitals, which orbitals form stronger bonds?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Hybrid orbitals possess same shape, size and energy. Hence the extent of overlapping is more in case of hybrid orbital. In hybrid orbital, the electron cloud is concentrated in the larger lobe which renders larger extent of overlapping and hence results in stronger bond.</p>

		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			In case of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NCl_3  \) </span> there are vacant 'd' orbitals in chlorine. The lone electron pair of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O  \) </span> molecule can be donated to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NCl_3  \) </span> as they occupy the vacant d orbitals.

But, in case of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NF_3  \) </span> fluorine has no vacant 'd' orbitals. Therefore lone pair of electrons in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O  \) </span> cannot be donated to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NF_3  \) </span> molecule.

This is because fluorine is more electronegative than oxygen where the bonded electron pairs lie closer to fluorine rather than oxygen atom in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  OF_2  \) </span>. In <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O  \) </span>, the bonded electron pairs lie closer to central atom. The repulsions between bonded electron pairs is more in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O  \) </span> than in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  OF_2  \) </span>.
