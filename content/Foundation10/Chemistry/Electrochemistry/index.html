	<p>Metals conduct electric current without any changes occurring in the metal. The conduction in them is due to flow of electrons. Unlike metals solution of salts, acids and alkalies too conduct electricity. The conduction in such cases involves chemical changes. The current conduction is due to movement of ions which are produced by the dissociation of these compounds. The conduction of electric current and their effects are studied under topic electrochemistry.</p>

		<p>When plates of two dissimilar metals are placed in a conducting liquid such as an aqueous solution of a salt or an acid, the resulting system becomes a source of electricity. This source of electricity is called as voltaic cell or galvanic cell in honor of Volta and Galvanic respectively. Electrochemical cell is a device which makes use of a spontaneous redox reaction for the generation of electrical energy. In this device chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy. Daniel cell is one example for such a device. These cells are also referred to as galvanic cells. The spontaneous oxidation - reduction reaction made use in the working of Daniel cell, <br />

			<br />
			An electrochemical cell consists of two half - cells and these are electrically connected to each other by a salt bridge. Oxidation reaction occurs in one half - cell and reduction reaction occurs in the other half cell.
			<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			In the Daniel cell, the two half cells are <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Zn/ZnSO_{4(aq)}  \) </span>(zinc rod dipped in zinc sulphate solution) and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Cu/CuSO_{4(aq)}  \) </span> (Cu rod dipped in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( CuSO_4  \) </span> solution). <br />

			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Zn \leftrightharpoons Zn^{++} + 2e^{-}  \) </span>
			<br />
			In <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( Cu/CuSO_{4(aq)}  \) </span> half cell, reduction reaction occurs <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Cu^{++}  + 2e \leftrightharpoons Cu  \) </span>
			<br />
			The total oxidation - reduction reaction is written as <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Zn + Cu_{(aq)}^{++} \leftrightharpoons Zn_{(aq)}^{++} + Cu  \) </span>

			<br />
			The two half cells are also referred to as single electrodes.
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Representation and notation of electrochemical cells with salt bridge </h5>
		<p> A daniel cell is constructed by combining a Zn electrode and a Cu electrode. As per IUPAC convention, electrode where oxidation occurs is written at the left hand side (LHS) and where reduction occurs is at the right hand side (RHS). A set of parallel lines is written in between these two single electrodes to indicate the salt bridge. Therefore daniel cell is represented as : <br />

			Mercury and lead are present below hydrogen in the electrochemical series. The oxidation potentials are low and their tendency to get oxidized is less. Hence their oxides are less stable.
