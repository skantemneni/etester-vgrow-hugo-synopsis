	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>An electric current can also produce magnetic effect. The term 'magnetic effect of current' means that 'a current flowing in a wire produces a magnetic field around it'. In other words, electric current can produce magnetism. The magnetic effect of current was
		discovered by Oersted in 1820. Oersted found that a wire carrying a current was able to deflect a compass needle. Now, the compass needle is a tiny magnet which can be defleted only by a magnetic field. Since a current carrying wire was able to deflect a compass needle, it was concluded that a current flowing in a wire always gives rise to a magnetic field around it. The importance of magnetic effects of current lies in the fact that it gives rise to mechanical forces. The electric motor, electric generator, telephone and radio all utilize the magnetic effects of current. The magnetic effects of current is also called electromagnetism which means electricity produces magnetism.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Magnetic field pattern due to straight current - carrying conductor (straight current - carrying Wire)</h4>
		<p>The magnetic field lines around a straight conductor (straight wire) carrying current are concentric circles whose centre lie on the wire. When current in the wire flows in the upward direction, then the lines of magnetic field are in the anticlockwise direction. If the direction of current in the wire is reversed, the direction of magnetic field lines also gets reversed. <br />
			It has been shown by experiments that the magnitude of magnetic field produced by a straight current - carrying wire at a given point is :</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>directly proportional to the current passing in the wire, and </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>inversely proportional to the distance of that point from the wire. </p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>So greater the current in the wire, stronger will be the magnetic field produced. And greater the distance of a point from the current-carrying wire, weaker will be the magnetic field produced at that point. In fact, as we move away from a current-carrying straight wire, the concentric circles around it representing magnetic field lines, becomes larger and larger indicating the decreasing strength of the magnetic field.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Direction of magnetic Field produced by current - carrying conductor</h4>
		<p>If the direction of current is known, then the direction of magnetic field produced by a straight wire carrying current can be obtained by using Maxwell's right - hand thumb rule. According to Maxwell's right - hand thumb rule : Imagine that you are grasping the current carrying wire in your right hand so that your thumb points in the direction of current, then the direction in which your fingers encircle the wire will give the direction of magnetic field lines around the wire. Maxwell's right - hand thumb rule is also known as Maxwell's corkscrew rule.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Magnetic Field Pattern due to a Circular Loop Carrying Current</h4>
		<p>When a current is passed through the circular loop of wire, a magnetic field is produced around it. The pattern of magnetic field due to a current carrying circular loop is shown in figure. The magnetic field lines are circular near the current-carrying loop. As we move away, the concentric circles representing magnetic field lines become bigger and bigger. At the centre of the circular loop, the magnetic field lines are straight. By applying right-hand thumb rule, it can be seen that each segment of circular loop carrying-current produces magnetic field lines in the same direction within the loop. At the centre of the circular loop, all the magnetic field lines are in the same direction and aid each other, due to which the strength of magnetic field increases. <br />
			The magnitude of magnetic field produced by a current - carrying circular loop at its centre is :

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Magnetic Field due to a Solenoid</h4>
		<p>The solenoid is a long coil containing a large number of close turns of insulated copper wire. The magnetic field produced by a current carrying solenoid is similar to the magnetic field produced by a bar magnet. The magnetic field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of parallel straight lines. This indicates that the strength of magnetic field is the same in a region , it is said to be uniform magnetic field. Thus, the magnetic field is uniform inside a current- carrying solenoid. The uniform magnetic field inside the current- carrying solenoid has been represented by drawing parallel straight field lines. Even the earth's magnetic field at a given place is uniform which consists of parallel straight field lines. <br />

		<p>An electric current can be used for making temporary magnets known as electromagnets. An electromagnet works on the magnetic effect of current. An electromagnet consists of a long coil of insulated copper wire wound on a soft iron core. The core of an electromagnet must be of soft iron because soft iron loses all of its magnetism when current in the coil is switched off. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Force on Current Carrying Conductor placed in a Magnetic Field</h4>
		<p>Oersted's experiment which shows that a current carrying wire exerts a force on a compass needle and deflects it from its usual north - south position. Since a compass needle is actually a small freely pivoted magnet, it can also say that a current carrying wire exerts a mechanical force on a magnet, and if the magnet is free to move, this force can produce a motion in the magnet. When a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, a mechanical force is exerted on the conductor which can make the conductor move. This is known as the motor principle and forms galvanometer. <br />
			When a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, a mechanics force is exerted on the conductor which makes it move. The direction of force acting on a current carrying wire placed in a magnetic field is </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>perpendicular to the direction of current, and </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field. </p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>The maximum force is exerted on a current carrying conductor only when it is perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field. No force acts on a current carrying conductor when it is parallel to the magnetic field. The direction of force on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field can be reversed by reversing the direction of current flowing in the conductor. The direction of force on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field can also be reversed by reversing the direction of magnetic field.

Adjust your hand in such a way that the forefinger points in the direction of magnetic field and the centre finger points in the direction of current, then the direction in which thumb points, gives the direction of force acting on the conductor. </p>

		<p>A transformer, is a device which transforms electric power in one circuit into electric power of same frequency into other circuit. A transformer can raise (step - up) or lower (step - down) the voltage in a circuit with a corresponding decrease or increase in a current. Transformer has no moving parts and it works on the principle of mutual induction. A transformer is used to transform low voltage current to high voltage low current. <br />
			A transformer can transform voltage with alternating current but not with direct current. One of the coils is called as primary coil and the other one is secondary coil. Primary coil is connected to a source of e.m.f. (A.C) and the secondary coil is connected to load. When A.C. passes through primary coil this flux associated with the secondary coil changes in accordance to A.C. This is due to mutual induction.
