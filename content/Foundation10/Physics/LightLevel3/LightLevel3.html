	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Light is one of the principal means by which we gain the knowledge of the world. Consequently, the understanding of nature of light becomes prime importance. In the study, whether the light has a particle nature or a wave nature has been revealed. Apart from this, the phenomenon are studied based on these theories. The present topic also deals with study of these theories along with understanding optical instruments, dispersion, scattering of light etc.</p>

		<p>The eye is one of our most important sense organs. For us to see properly, the eye primarily performs three functions: it makes adjustments to admit appropriate amount of light, it bends the rays of light to form a sharp image, and it collects and sends information about the image to the brain for further 'processing'. Different parts of the eye perform these functions. <br />
			The different parts of the eye are contained with in the spherical eyeball, which is about 2.5 cm in diameter.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Atmospheric refraction and optical phenomena</h4>
		<p>The earth is surrounded by a layer of air called the atmosphere, which extends several hundred kilometres above its surface. Density of air in the atmosphere is not the same everywhere. In general, it is greatest at the earth's surface and goes on decreasing as we move higher. The refractive index of air depends on its density - higher the density of air, greater its refractive index. Because of atmospheric refraction, a heavenly body always appears higher in the sky than its actual position. <br />
			All the air in the atmosphere is not at the same temperature. Some of the air layers of the atmosphere are cold whereas other air layers of the atmosphere are comparatively warm(or hotter). Now the cooler air layers of the atmosphere behave as optically denser medium for light rays whereas the warmer the air layers of the atmosphere behave as optically rarer medium for the light rays. So, in the same atmosphere we have air layers having different optical densities. And when light rays pass through the atmosphere having air layers of different optical densities, then refraction of light takes place . The refraction of light caused by the earth's atmosphere having air layers of varying optical densities is called atmospheric refraction. <br />

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Dispersion of light</h4>
		<p>In the year 1665, Newton discovered by his experiment with glass prisms that white light (like sunlight) consists of a mixture of seven colours. The band of seven colours formed on a white screen, when a beam of white light is passed through a glass prism, is called spectrum of white light. The seven colours of the spectrum are: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet. The splitting up of white light into seven colours on passing through a transparent medium like a glass prism is called dispersion of light. The dispersion of white light occurs because of the angle of refraction (or angle of bending) of lights of different colours is different when passing through the glass prism. The red colour is deviated least, violet colour is deviated the maximum.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Interference</h4>
		<p>When two light waves superimpose, the resultant amplitude or intensity in the region of superposition is different than the amplitude or intensity of the individual waves. This modification in the distribution of intensity of the individual waves. This modification in the distribution of intensity in the region of superposition is called interference. <br />
			When the resultant amplitude is the sum of amplitudes due to the two waves, the interference is known as constructive interference. When the resultant amplitude is the difference of amplitudes due to the two waves, the interference is known as destructive interference.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Diffraction</h4>
		<p>The bending of light rays around the edges of an obstacle or aperture is called diffraction. Diffraction can be noticed when the size of the obstacle is comparable to that of wave length of light and for extended sources. The amount of bending of light depends upon the size of obstacle and the wavelength of the wave.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Types of electromagnetic radiations</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Visible spectrum:</span>
			<br/>
			The visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum is most familiar to us, because our eye is sensitive to this region. The wavelength of the visible spectrum extends about <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0.4 \ \mu m  \) </span> to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0.7 \ \mu m  \) </span> , that is, from violet colour to red colour. Visible spectrum is emitted when the excited valence electrons in atoms jump back to their normal states. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Infrared (IR) spectrum:</span>
			<br/>
			Infrared radiations have wavelengths larger than those of visible light. That is from <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0.7 \ \mu m  \) </span> to about <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  100 \ \mu m  \) </span> . They are emitted by molecules when they change their states of rotational or vibrational motion. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Microwaves:</span>
			<br/>
			Micro waves are electromagnetic waves with wavelengths in the range <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10 \ \mu m  \) </span> to 10 m. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Radio waves:</span>
			<br/>
			Radio waves have wavelenghts from 1 m to about 100 km <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Ultraviolet(UV) spectrum:</span>
			<br/>
			The radiations of wavelengths shorter than the visible light ranging from about <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0.4 \ \mu m  \) </span> to 1 nm are called ultraviolet(UV) radiations. These radiations are produced by the transitions of the electrons in atoms. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">X - rays:</span>
			<br/>
			X - rays are produced in discrete wavelenghts in individual transitions among the inner electrons of an atom. Wavelength of X - rays range from 0.001 nm(<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0.01^{\circ} A  \) </span>) to 10 nm (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  100^{\circ} A  \) </span>). <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Gamma <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \gamma  \) </span> rays:</span>
			<br/>
			Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiations with shortest wavelengths ranging from 0.0001 nm to 0.1 nm or from <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0.001^{\circ} A  \) </span> to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1^{\circ} A  \) </span>. They are the most penetrating electromagnetic radiations.</p>

		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Question:</span>
			<br />
			In what respects is Huygens' wave theory of light similar to Maxwell's electromagnetic theory? In what respect are the two theories different?
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The two theories are similar in the respect that according to both the theories, light is a wave motion. On the other hand, the two theories are different in the respect that according to electromagnetic theory, light does not require any material medium for its propagation; a material medium is necessary for the propagation of light wave according to the wave theory. For this, Huygens assumed the existence of the all pervading either medium.

		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The angle of incidence must not be less than <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( 30^{\circ}  \) </span> because in that case the light ray, after refraction, goes through the first surface and enters the prism but due to total internal reflection by the second surface, it will not come out of the prism.

			<br />
			A person having a myopic eye uses a concave lens of focal length 50 cm. What is its nature ?
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Here we have a concave lens. Now, the focal length of a concave lens is considered negative, so it is to be written with a minus sign.<br />
			Thus, Focal length, f = -50 cm<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  = - \frac{50}{100} m = -0.5 m  \\\\[3pt]
				Now, \ power, \ p = \frac{1}{f(in \ meters)}  \\\\[3pt]
				p = \frac{1}{-0.5}  \\\\[3pt]
				p = - \frac{1 \times 10}{5}  \\\\[3pt]
				p = -2 \ dioptres \ (or \ -2D)  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Thus, the power of this concave lens is, -2 dioptres, which can also written as, -2D. The minus with the power indicates that it is a diverging lens or concave lens.

			<br />
			The power of this lens has positive sign, so it is a convex lens. Now, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  Power, \ p = \frac{1}{f(in \ meters)}  \\\\[3pt]

			<br />
			Is the focal length of a lens the same for lights of all colours.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>

			<span class="highlight01">Question:</span>
			<br />
			Eye is more sensitive to yellow colour. Why are then danger signals red ?
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The scattering (rayleigh scattering) of light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength of light. So, the scattering of red light is much less than the yellow light and accordingly, the red light signals can be seen upto a longer distance without much loss in their intensity. For this reason, the danger signals are red in colour.

			<span class="highlight01">Question:</span>
			<br />
			Explain, why white light is dispersed when passing through a prism.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The velocity of light in a material medium depends upon its colour (wavelength) i.e the refractive index of a material is different for different colours. If we incident a ray of white light on a prism ; on emerging, the different colours are deviated through different angles. Due to this, white light splits into its constituent colours and the phenomenon is called dispersion.

			<br />
			A ray of white light shows no dispersion on emerging from a glass plate (slab). Is there no dispersion inside the glass plate as well ?
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The light disperses into different colours on entering the glass slab i.e. dispersion takes place inside a glass slab also. But when it emerges from its other parallel face, the different colours again combine to form white light.

		<div class="list1-ol default-spaced-indented list-numbered-style-lower-alpha">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>When the object is at infinity, the image forms at the focus of the lens (v = f). Hence, the focal length in this case is 2.5 cm. Thus the power is <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( p = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{2.5 \times 10^{-2}m} = 40D  \) </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In this case, the object is at 25 cm from the eye - lens, and the image is formed at 2.5 cm from the eye - lens. So, u = -25 cm, v = 2.5 cm. Then <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{2.5 cm} + \frac{1}{25 cm}  \\\\[3pt]
