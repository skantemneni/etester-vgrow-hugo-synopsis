	<p>When an electric current is passed through a high resistance wire, like nichrome wire, the resistance wire becomes very hot and produces heat. This is called the heating effect of current. The heating effect of current is obtained by the transformation of electrical energy into heat energy. </p>
	<p>A current flowing through solids such as a copper wire, the filament of a bulb, the element of an electric heater produces heat. If a current is allowed to flow through certain liquids then a chemical change usually takes place. So this effect of electric current that brings out a chemical change is called as chemical effects of electric current.

		<p>Most dangerous subsequences of using electricity are electric shock and electric fire. They are usually caused by damaged insulation, overheating of cables or damped conditions. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Damaged insulation</h5>
		<p>This damaged insulation would result in : <br />
			Severe electric shock leading to serious injury or even death. <br />
			Short circuit in the current path by connecting exposed current-carrying conductors together.

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Overheating of cables</h5>
		<p>This overheating of cables would result in : <br />
			Melting of the insulation and catching fire.
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Damping condition</h5>
		<p>This damp condition, coupled with unsafe usage of electrical appliances, would result in: <br />
			Large currents flowing through our body causing electrical shock and leading to serious injury or even death.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Safe use of electricity in the home</h4>
		<p>Electricity is supplied to the house through the mains: <br />
			Live wire (L) : high-voltage (240 V) wire or main wire that carries current into the house circuit. <br />
			Neutral wire (N); zero-voltage wire or main wire that carries current out of the house circuit.
		</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104390006_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>Current is carried into the house by the live wire (L) through a main fuse, an electricity  meter, a main switch and a consumer distribution unit (fuse box) as shown and then returned from the house via the neutral wire (N) to the public power supply. </p>
		<p>Connecting an electrical appliance between a pair of live and neutral wires, forms a complete circuit. A voltage difference (240 - 0 V) is set up between the terminals of electrical appliance resulting in a current flowing through the appliance. The electrical energy is then converted in the appliance into other form of useful energy (refer to figure).
		</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Fuse and circuit breakers</h4>
		<p>In order to prevent excessive currents flowing into the home circuit, electrical appliances and its cables, fuses and circuit breakers are wired into the live wire and used as safety devices. </p>
		<p>A fuse is usually made up of a tin-coated copper wire. When currents exceeds its design rating value. The wire will overheat and melt, thus opening the electrical circuit. It will prevent further damage to the appliance or user. It cannot be resused. </p>
		<p>A circuit breaker is usally made up of a reusable spring-loaded type of switch. The function of the circuit breaker is similar to that of the fuse. If current exceeds its breaking setting it will spring open and break the circuit as in a fuse. The device can be reused by resetting the spring-loaded switch.
		</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104390006_image-2.png" alt="image2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>It is correct to fix the fuse or circuit breaker at the live wire before the appliance. When the circuit is loaded with excessive current, the fuse or circuit breaker will break and open the circuit. It will prevent overloading, burning or damaging of the appliance. </p>
		<p>Connecting the fuse or circuit breaker to the neutral wire is incorrect, i.e., even when the circuit is opened due to excessive currents , the appliance may still be at live potential, creating possibility of an electric shock. </p>
		<p>The current limit through the fuse (fuse rating) can be controlled by varying the thickness of the tin-coated copper wire. Thicker the wire, the larger the heating effect needed melt the connection, thus permitting larger current to flow. </p>
		<p>Different fuse ratings and circuit breaker settings are used in different appliances according to their power requirements. The rating limit used is normally slightly higher than the normal current needed by the appliance.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Switch</h4>
		<p>Switch is used to open or close the electrical circuit, connecting the appliance.</p>
		<p>It is correct to fix the switch at the live wire after the fuse, but before the appliance. </p>
		<p>Connecting the switch to the neutral wire is incorrect, i.e., even when the circuit is opened, the appliance may still be at live potential, creating possibility of an electric shock.

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Need for earthing and double insulation</h4>
		<p>Sometimes, even the fuse cannot capture the high currents coming from the live wire into the household appliance, earthing further protects the user of the appliance from electric shock by connecting the metal casing of the appliance to earth (a wired connection to the bare ground).</p>
		<p>In the event that the metal casing of the appliance becomes live, earthing diverts large currents into the earth by providing an alternate path to the large current flow via the earth wire, rather than through the user's body.</p>
		<p>Alternatively, instead of earthing, appliance can be made with double insulation. Double insulation protects the user of the appliance from an electrical shock by preventing any possibility of the external casing becoming live, thus eliminating the need for an earth connection.</p>
		<p>First insulation : Insulating electrical cable from the internal component of the appliance.</p>
		<p>Second insulation : Insulating internal metal part which could become live from the external casing.</p>
		<p>Remove a sufficient amount of outer insulation of the three core wires, Live (brown), Neutral (blue) and Earth (green with yellow). </p>
		<p>Open the mains plug with a screwdriver and take out the fuse.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Chemical effects of Current</h3>
	<p>Electric current can bring about chemical changes. So it is said to have a chemical effect. For example, when electric current is passed through a copper sulphate solution by using carbon electrodes, then a chemical reaction takes place to form copper metal sulphuric acid and oxygen gas: <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{Copper \ sulphate}{2CuSO_4} + \underset{water}{2 H_2O} \rightarrow \underset{Copper \ metal}{2Cu} + \underset{Sulphuric \ acid}{2H_2SO_4} + \underset{Oxygen}{O_2}  \) </span>
	</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="104390006_image-5.png" alt="image5" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>This reaction is an example of the chemical effects of current. When we pass electric current through copper sulphate solution using carbon electrodes, then copper metal is deposited as a reddish layer on the negatively charged carbon electrode (cathode) as shown in figure. The longer the current flows, more copper is deposited on the negative carbon electrode. The oxygen gas is liberated at the positively charged carbon electrode (anode), whereas sulphuric acid solution is gradually converted into sulphuric acid solution. The process which is just described is called electrolysis of copper sulphate solution. </p>
	<p>The decomposition of an electrolyte by the action of electric current is called electrolysis. </p>
	<p>In electrolysis 1 faraday is defined as the quantity of electricity required to liberate 1 gram - equivalent of a substance at the electrode. </p>
	<p>1 faraday is the quantity of electricity possessed by 1 mole of electrons <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( 6.023 \times 10^{23} electrons \right )  \) </span>, and it is equal to 96500 coulombs. Thus : </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Faraday's First Law of Electrolysis </h4>
		<p>Michael Faraday carried out a series of experiments in which he passed current through an electrolyte for different durations of time and weighed the mass of the substance which was deposited (or produced) at the electrode in each case. He found that longer the current is passed through an electrolyte, more is the mass of the substance deposited on the electrode. From the results of such experiments, he discovered the first law of electrolysis. </p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">The mass of a substance produced (or deposited) on an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte. </span>
		</p>
		<p>If Q is the quantity of electricity passed and m is the mass of the substance produced then :<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  m \propto Q  \) </span>
		</p>
		<p>We know that <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Q = I \times t  \) </span>, we can write the above relation as : <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  m \propto I \times t  \ \ m = Z \times I \times t  \) </span>
		</p>
		<p>Where Z is a constant known as 'electrochemical equivalent' of the substance (or element).Thus, the Faraday's first law of electrolysis gives us the formula : </p>
		<p>Mass of substance deposited,  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( m = Z \times I \times t  \) </span>
			<br />
			where Z = electrochemical equivalent of the substance <br />
			I = current passed (in amperes) <br />
			and	t = time in seconds (for which the current is passed)
		</p>
		<p>If 1 ampere current is passed for 1 second (so that the quantity of electricity passed is 1 coulomb), then the equation <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( m = Z \times I \times t  \) </span> becomes <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( m = Z \times 1 \times 1  \) </span> or m = Z. Under these conditions, the mass of substance deposited becomes equal to its chemical equivalent. This gives us the following definition of electrochemical equivalent.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Faraday's Second Law of Electrolysis </h4>
