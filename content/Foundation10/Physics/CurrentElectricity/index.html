	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Current electricity is the study of various effects of electrical charges in motion. The basis for its study is electric current. On the other hand the advancement in understanding current electricity came with the invention of batteries. Batteries could make charge flow continuously as a current. This development eventually led to the modern electric circuits. Apart from this, the study of ohm's law its limitations leads us to the further study of semiconductor devices that have obvious impact on our lives.</p>

		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V \propto I  \) </span>
		<br />
		or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V = RI,  \) </span>

			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R = \frac{V}{I}  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Unit of resistance</h5>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Ohmic and non-ohmic conductors</h4>
		<p>The conductors which obey Ohm's law are called ohmic conductors. For such conductors the relation between current and potential difference is linear. Hence they are also called linear conductors. All metallic conductors are ohmic conductors. Thus, Ohm's law is obeyed only by metallic conductors.<br />
			Those devices or conductors which does not obey Ohm's law are called non-ohmic or non-linear conductors. For such conductors the graph between current and potential difference is not a straight line but a curved line. Junction diode, semiconductors and electrolytes are examples of non-ohmic conductors.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Semiconductor devices</h4>
		<p>In the present day generation, electronic devices play a vital role in the fields of communication, space exploration, controlling devices, bio medical devices etc. These devices incorporate semiconductors whose special properties make them important.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Insulators</h5>
		<p>A very poor conductor of electricity is called an insulator. Plastic, wood, diamond etc. are some examples of insulators. In an insulator, the forbidden gap is large and the concentration of free electrons is small (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \thicksim 10^7  \) </span> per cubic meter).</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Conductors</h5>
		<p>Substances that conduct electricity efficiently are known as electric conductors. All metals like silver, copper, aluminium etc., are good conductors of electricity. In a conductor, valence band and conduction band overlap and there is no physical distinction between them.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Semiconductors</h5>
		<p>In a solid, if the forbidden gap is relatively small, that is about 1 eV the solid is called a semiconductor. Pure germanium and silicon are well-known examples of semiconductors. The value of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  E_G  \) </span> for pure silicon is about 1.1 eV and for pure germanium it is about 0.72 eV at room temperature. The conductivity of a semiconductor depends on its temperature.</p>

		 </div>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Energy band diagram</span>
		</p>
		<p>Depending on the relative concentration of electrons and holes, the semiconductors are classified into two types they are:</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Intrinsic semiconductors</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Extrinsic semiconductors</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Intrinsic semiconductors</h5>
		<p>A pure semiconductor is known as intrinsic semiconductor. In an intrinsic semiconductor, the number of electrons in the conduction band and the number of holes in the valence band are equal.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Extrinsic semiconductors</h5>
		<p>An extrinsic semiconductor is one which contains small quantities of selected impurities introduced into an intrinsic semiconductor. The process of introducing impurities in small quantities into a material is called 'doping'.<br />
			An extrinsic semiconductor is a doped semiconductor. The extrinsic semiconductors can be of two types depending on the type of impurity. They are</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>p-type semiconductors</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>n-type semiconductors</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">p-type Semiconductors</h5>
		<p>A p-type semiconductor is formed when a small quantity of acceptor impurity is added to the pure semiconductor. In a p-type semiconductor, conduction is mainly by means of holes in the valence band. Hence, holes are called "majority carriers" whereas electrons are called minority carriers in a p-type semiconductor<br />
			Germanium (Ge) or Silicon (Si) have 4 valence electrons and can form 4 covalent bond. Trivalent atoms such as Gallium (Ga), Indium (In), Aluminium (Al), Boron (B) etc., have three valence electrons. When these atoms are added as impurities to Ge, the 4 valence electrons of Ge tend to share 4 more electrons to form 4 covalent bonds. However, the trivalent impurity can provide only three electrons. Therefore, these four covalent bonds become short of one electron. This shortage of an electron is equivalent to a hole. This means, each trivalent impurity atom creates one hole in the semiconductor.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">n-type Semiconductors</h5>
		<p>A n-type semiconductor is formed when a small quantity of donor impurity is added to a pure semiconductor. In a n-type semiconductor, thus, conduction is mainly by means of electrons in the conduction band. Hence, electrons are the "majority carriers" whereas holes are the minority carriers in a n-type semiconductor.<br />
			Pentavalent atoms such as Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb), Phosphorus (P) etc., have five valence electrons. When such an impurity is added to silicon or germanium, which are tetravalent, the 4 valence electrons of Ge tend to share 4 more electrons of pentavalent impurity to form 4 covalent bonds. Since, the pentavalent impurity can provide 5 electrons, there is an excess of one electron. This means, each pentavalent impurity atom creates one excess electrons in the semiconductor.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Note:</span>
			<br />
			Addition of either trivalent or pentavalent impurity to an intrinsic semiconductor does in no way affect the electrical neutrality. Thus, p-type and n-type semiconductors are electrically neutral.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Formation of p-n Junction</h5>
		<p>When a p-type semiconductor is suitably joined to a n-type semiconductor, a contact is established between them and is called a p-n junction.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Formation of Depletion Region</h5>
		<p>The region close to p-n junction is depleted of mobile charge carriers and is called 'depletion region'.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">p-n Junction Diode</h5>
		<p>The p-n junction consisting of p-type and n-type semiconductors provided with two terminals is called a p-n junction diode.</p>

			i.e., Resistance, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R \propto \frac{1}{A}  \) </span> (where A is area of cross-section of conductor).</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Effect of the Nature of Material of the Conductor:</h5>
		<p>The electrical resistance of a conductor (say, a wire) depends on the nature of the material of which it is made. Some materials have low resistance whereas others have high resistance.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Effect of temperature:</h5>
		<p>The resistance of all pure metals increases on raising the temperature; and decreases on lowering the temperature. But the resistance of alloys like manganin, constantan and nichrome is almost unaffected by temperature.<br />

			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The first step in solving such problems based on current electricity is to draw a proper circuit diagram. For example, in this problem we have two resistances of 3 ohms and 5 ohms which are connected in series. So, first of all we have to draw two resistances on paper. Now, a potential difference of 6 volts has been applied across this combination of resistances. So, we draw a cell or a battery of 6 volts and complete the circuit. Suppose the current flowing in the circuit is I amperes. <br />
			We will now find out the value of current I flowing through the circuit. To do this we should know the total resistance R of the circuit. Here we have two resistances of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3 \Omega \ and \ 5 \Omega  \) </span> connected in series. So, <br />
			Total resistance, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( R = R_1 + R_2  \) </span>
			<br />
			R = 3 + 5 <br />
			R = 8 ohms <br />
			Now, Total resistance, R = 8 ohms <br />
			Potential difference, V = 6 volts <br />
			and, Current in the circuit, I = ? <br />
			So, applying Ohm's law to the whole circuit, we get: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{V}{I} = R  \) </span>
			<br />
			so that, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{6}{I} = 8  \) </span>
			<br />
			And, 8I = 6 <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( I = \frac{6}{8}  \) </span>
			<br />
			So, Current, I = 0.75 amperes <br />
			The second part of this problem is to find out the potential difference across the ends of the 3 ohms resistance. To do this we will have to apply Ohm's law to this resistance only. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span> Current (through <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3 \Omega  \) </span> resistance), I = 0.75 amperes <br />
			And, Resistance, R = 3 ohms <br />
			So, applying Ohm's law to the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3 \Omega  \) </span> resistance only, we get : <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \frac{V}{I} = R  \\\\[3pt]
				or \ \frac{V}{0.75} = 3  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			So, Potential difference, V = 2.25 V <br />
			Thus, the potential difference across the 3 ohm resistance is 2.25 volts.
