	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>In 600 B.C., the Greek philosopher Thales observed that amber, when rubbed with wool, acquires the property of attracting objects like small bits of paper, dry leaves, dust particles, etc., There are many other substances like amber, which can also acquire the property of attracting such light objects on being rubbed with suitable substances. The amber, glass rod, ebonite rod or plastic comb are said to be electrified or charged with electricity. Wool (in case of amber), silk (in case of glass rod) and fur (in case of ebonite rod) are also found to be electrically charged. Static electricity is the study of charges under rest.

In any physical process, the charge may get transferred from one part of the system to another, but net charge will always remains the same.

			<br />
			What is the significance of electric field ?
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The concept of electric field is of a great significance. Two charges kept at a distance exert force on each other, which is termed as action at a distance. The concept of electric field helps us to understand the mechanism by which two charges kept at a distance exert force on each other. Further, as an alternative to Coulomb's law in electrostatics, it gives a method to find the force experienced by one charge due to the other in terms of the electric field produced by it.     .
