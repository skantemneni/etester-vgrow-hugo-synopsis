	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Light is a form of energy which enables us to see objects. The objects like the sun, lamp, candle etc., which emit their own light are called luminous objects. The objects like a chair or a table do not have light of their own but even then we are able to see them. Those objects which do not emit light themselves but only reflect (or scatter) the light which falls on them, are called non-luminous objects. So, a chair or table are non-luminous objects.<br />
		Light travels in straight lines. There are two theories about the nature of light: wave theory of light and particle theory of light. According to wave theory: Light consists of electromagnetic waves which do not require a material medium (like solid, liquid or gas) for their propagation. The wavelength of visible light waves is very small (being only about <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  4 \times 10^{-7} \ m  \) </span> to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  8 \times 10^{-7} \ m  \) </span>). The speed of light waves is very high (being about <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3 \times 10^8  \) </span> meters per second in vacuum).<br />
		Some of the phenomena of light can be explained only if light is considered to be made up of waves whereas others can be explained only if light is considered to be made up of particles. For example, the phenomena of diffraction (bending of light around the corners of tiny objects), interference and polarization of light can only be explained if light is considered to be of wave nature. So light has a dual nature.</p>

<section class="skill" id="02">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Reflection of light</h3>
	<p>When light falls on the surface of an object, it may be absorbed, transmitted, or reflected. If an object absorbs all the light which falls on it, then it will appear perfectly black. If an object transmits the light, that is, if the object allows the light to pass through itself, the object is said to be transparent. When light is transmitted (or passes) through a transparent object, it bends somewhat from its original path. And this is called refraction of light. Most of the objects, however, reflect some of the light which falls on their surface. From this it can be concluded that when light falls on the surface of an object, some of it is sent back. The process of sending back the light rays which fall on the surface of an object, is called reflection of light.</p>

	<p>An optical fibre is a device based on total internal reflection by which a light signal can be transferred from one place to another with a negligible loss of energy. <br /> 
		It consists of a thin transparent fibre made of glass or plastic known as core. The core is coated with a material of lower refractive index known as cladding. This coating prevents absorption of light by dust and scratches on its surface. A large number of fibres are
		,me	carefully arranged to form a bundle or a cable (Fig. 34). They are arranged so that the fibres are parallel to one another throughout. This prevents any distortion of the transmitted image.</p>
