	<p>A random experiment is a process involving chance that generates a result called outcome. In general, there are two or more possible outcomes in a random expe The probability that an outcome will occur is a measure of the change of the occ of the outcome. <br />
		The set of the possible outcomes is called the sample space, usually denoted by S. A of some of the possible outcomes is called an event, usually denoted by E. In words, an event E is a subset of the sample space S. <br />
		For a finite sample space with equally likely outcomes, the probability of an event denoted by P(E), is given by <br />
		A summary of the basic properties of probability is given below. <br />

			<li>
				<p> probability that both events A and B will occur as P(A and B); </p>

			</li>

	</div>
	<p> In a sample space, two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. </p>

		<img src="104190009_image-4.png" alt="image4" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p> For example, in rolling a die, <br />
		event A = {1, 3, 5} and event B = {2, 4} <br />
		are mutually exclusive. This is because when the die shows 1, 3 or 5, it definitely cannot show 2 or 4. <br />
		Note that <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  A \cap B = \phi  \) </span>. That means, two events, A and B, are mutually exclusive if <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  A \cap B = \phi  \) </span>.<br />
		Let us investigate the relationships between P(A), P(B), P(A and B) and P(A or B) for two  mutually exclusive events, A and B. <br />
		If A and B are two mutually exclusive events, then the probability of A or B occurring is</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Independent Events</h3>
	<p> Let us study another type of combination of events. Intuitively, two events are said to be  <span class="highlight01"> independent events </span> if the occurrence or non-occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other event. <br />
		For example, in tossing a fair coin twice, the event A that the first toss shows a head and the event B that the second toss shows a head are independent. That is, event A does not affect how likely event B will occur, and vice versa. <br />
		If A and B are independent events, the probability of both events A and B occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. <br />
		ie.,  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P(A \ and \ B) = P(A) \times P(B)  \) </span>. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Further Probabilities</h3>
	<p> Consider drawing two balls at random from a bag containing 3 red balls and 5 green balls. Suppose the balls are drawn one by one without replacement. <br />
		Let A be the event that the first ball drawn is red, <br />
		B be the event that cue second ball drawn is green. <br />
		At first, there are 8 balls in the bag. After drawing the first ball, there will be 7 balls left in the bag.</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p> If event A happens (i.e, the first ball drawn is red), the remaining balls are 2 red ones and 5 green ones. <br />
					Hence, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P(B) = \frac{5}{7}  \) </span>. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> If event A does not happen (i.e., that first ball drawn is not red), the remaining balls are 3 red ones and 4 green ones. <br />
					Hence, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P(B) = \frac{4}{7}  \) </span>. <br />
					That means, the probability of event B depends on whether event A will occur or not  Thus, A and B are NOT independent events. How do we calculate the probability of both events A and B occurring if they are not independent? <br />
					We can also use a tree diagram to do this. In the tree diagram, the probabilities indicating the second stage branches will depend on the results of the first stage.</p>

		= P(RG) <br />
		= <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{5}{7}  \) </span>
		<br />
		In general, when the occurrence of the second event depends on the occurrence of the first event, we may use a tree diagram to help us compute the probabilities. </p>

			<br />
			What are the odds is favour of obtaining a sum of 7 when a pair of dice is tossed once?  </p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution: </span>
			<br />
			Using our definition, we first find probability of obtaining a sum of 7 when a pair of dice is tossed. It is  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{6}{36}  \) </span> .Next, we find the probability of not getting a 7. Recall that if  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P(A) = \frac{S}{T}  \) </span>,then  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P(not \ A) = 1 - \frac{S}{T}  \) </span>. Hence, we have <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P(7) = \frac{6}{36}  \) </span> and  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P(not \ 7) = 1 - \frac{6}{36} = \frac{36}{36} - \frac{6}{36} = \frac{30}{36}   \) </span>
			<br />
			Alternatively, if there are 6 ways in 36 that we may obtain a 7, then the remaining 3, ways in 36 is the probability of not obtaining a 7. <br />
			Now we construct our ratio according to the definition: <br />
			Odds in favour of A  = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{Probability \ that \ A will \ occur}{Probability \ that \ A will \ not \ occur}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Odds in favour of 7 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( = \frac{\frac{6}{36}}{\frac{30}{36}} = \frac{6}{36} \times \frac{36}{30} = \frac{6}{30} = \frac{1}{5}  \) </span>. <br />
			The odds in favour of obtaining a 7 are t <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{5}  \) </span>. But remember that the odds may also be stated as 1 to 5 or 1:5. </p>

		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> Question: </span>
			<br />
			What are the odds against obtaining an 11 when a pair of dice is tossed once?  </p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution: </span>
			<br />
			Using the definition, we still find the probability in favour of getting an 11 and probability against getting and the 11 when a pair of dice is tossed. The probability of getting an 11 is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{2}{36}  \) </span>, and the probability of not getting an 11 is <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1 - \frac{2}{36} = \frac{36}{36} - \frac{2}{36} = \frac{34}{36}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Now we construct our ratio according to the definition:  <br />
			Odds against an 11 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{\frac{34}{36}}{\frac{2}{36}} = \frac{34}{36} \times \frac{36}{2} = \frac{17}{1}  \) </span>. <br />
			The odds against obtaining an 11 are <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   \frac{17}{1}  \) </span>.which we would usually write as 17 to 1, or 17:1. Therefore, from the odds (17 : 1), we can see that we probably are not going to 225 an 11 when we roll the dice. Over the long run, we should get an 11 once out of every tries. This si not a very good percentage of successful outcomes. </p>
