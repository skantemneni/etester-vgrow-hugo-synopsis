	<h3 class="skill-heading">Four Enumeration Principles</h3>
	<p>To answer such questions as How many ways are there to give 30 books to seven friends? as well as much more difficult questions, we use the following enumeration rules and principles. <br />
		Let A and B be sets with m and n elements, respectively; i.e., <br />
		let n(A) = m; n(B) = n
	</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-heading">Rule of product</h4>
		<p> The number of ways of forming an ordered pair (a, b) such that a <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \epsilon  \) </span> A and b <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \epsilon  \) </span> B; equals m.n. In other words: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n(A \times B) = m.n  \) </span>
		</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-heading">Rule of sum</h4>
		<p>If sets A and B are disjoint, then the number of ways of picking one element from their union equals the sum m + n. In other words: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  A \cap B = \theta \Rightarrow n(A \cup B) = m + n  \) </span>
		</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-heading">Principle of inclusion - exclusion </h4>
		<p>In general when A and B are not necessarily disjoint, the following is true: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (A \cap B = C \ |C| = p \geq 0) \Rightarrow n(A \cup B) = m + n - p  \) </span>
		</p>

			<img src="104190014_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p> With the principle of inclusion - exclusion. If n(A) = m, n(B) = n, and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n(A \cap B) = p  \) </span>, then <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n(A \cup B) = m + n - p  \) </span>.<br />
			It is easy to see that the principle of inclusion-exclusion is a consequence of the rule of sum. Consider the above figure. First of all note that sets B - C and C are disjoint and their union equals A and B - C are disjoint and their union equals the union of A and B. we find that <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n(A \cup B) = n(A \cup (B - C))  \) </span>
			<br />
			= m + n - p <br />
			In other words the union of two sets in the general case does not have m + n elements because this sum counts the common elements of A and B twice. To obtain the correct result, we must subtract p, the number of elements in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  A \cap B  \) </span>.

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-heading">Dirichlet's principle </h4>
		<p>If n disjoint sets contain n + 1 elements, at least one of them has more than one element. <br />
			Although these principles are very simple, they are used to solve even very difficult problems.

		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Question:</span>
			<br />
			How many elements are there in the set given by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  A = \{n, \ n + 1, \ ...., n^2 \} ? \) </span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution: </span>
			<br />
			It is obvious that <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n(A) = n^2 - n + 1  \) </span>, but let us try to justify this answer. What does it actually mean to enumerate the elements of a set? If A has r <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \epsilon  \) </span> N elements, then each element can be assigned an order, a number from the set <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  N_r = \{1, \ 2, \ 3, \ .... , \ r \}  \subset N  \) </span>. <br />
			In our problem, we assign order 1 to n, order 2 to n + 1, and so on. The question now is what is the order of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( n^2 ?  \) </span> We notice that in this case, the difference between the element of A and its order is always n - 1. Therefore the order of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( n^2  \) </span> is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n^2 - (n - 1) = n^2 - n + 1  \) </span>, which implies that <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n(A) = n^2 - n + 1  \) </span>.

			How many seven-digit phone numbers begin with 432 and end with 3 or 5?
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution: </span>
			<br />
			The fourth digit can be selected from 10 possible choices: 0, 1, 2, ...., 9. The same is true for the fifth and the sixth digit.

		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution: </span>
			<br />
			Since each pair of different points defines a line, in this problem we are actually interested in counting all pairs of different points that can be formed from the n given points. The first point can be picked in n different ways, while the other can be picked in (n - 1) ways since it must differ from the first. Hence the number of pairs is n(n - 1). <br />
			Please note that every line formed in this way appears twice because, for example, ordered pairs (A, B) and (B, A) define the same line: <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  AB \equiv BA  \) </span>. Therefore, the number of lines is twice as small as the number of ordered pairs, it equals <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}.  \) </span>

			<br />
			How many seven-digit phone numbers begin with 215-2 if the last three digits must differ among themselves, they cannot be 0, 2, or 5; and the last digit cannot be 1?
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution: </span>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">solution 1: </span>
						<br />
						Let us try to solve this problem as follows. We cannot change the first four digits; these are fixed. The fifth digit can be selected from the set {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}, i.e., in seven different ways. The sixth digit must differ from the fifth, so it can be picked in six ways. The last digit must be different from the fifth and the sixth, so without the last condition, we could pick it in five ways. Due to the last condition we cannot select the last digit in four ways, because if the fifth or sixth digit were 1, the last digit can be selected in five ways, not four. <br />
						Let us divide the set of all phone numbers satisfying these conditions into three disjoint sets, the set of numbers having neither a fifth nor sixth digit equal to 1, the set of numbers having 1 at the fifth plane, and the set of numbers having 1 at the sixth place.<br />
						In the first set, there are 6.5.4 choices. In the second set the first five digits are fixed, so there are 6.5 choices. Similarly in the third set, there are 6.5 choices. Therefore 6 . 5 . 4 + 1 . 6 . 5 + 6 . 1 . 5 = 180 phone numbers have the required properties. <br />
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Solution 2: </span>
						<br />
						The solution can be obtained much more easily if we begin with the last digit, which can be picked from {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}, i.e., in 6 ways. Once it is selected, we can select the sixth digit in six ways, too, because although we cannot repeat the last digit, we can use digit 1. The fifth digit can be selected in five ways. The result is the same as before: 6 . 6 . 5 = 180. <br />

						Let us consider the third way to solve this problem. From, the total number of phone numbers that can be formed using different digits from {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} at their last three places, we subtract the number of phone numbers having 1 at the last place. 7 . 6 . 5 - 6. 5 = 180.

			First calculate the sums in each of these subsets and in the remainders after division by n. If some of these remainders is 0, we have the subset we seek.

			<br />
			Canonical decomposition of 2520 is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( 2520 = 2^3 . 3^2 . 5 . 7  \) </span>, so all divisors of 2520 can be written as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2^a . 3^b . 5^c . 7^d  \) </span>, where <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a, \ b, \ c, \ d \geq 0  \) </span>; each of these is less than or equal to the corresponding exponent in the decomposition of 2520.

			A, B, C, D, E and F are six points. Straight line segments are drawn to connect each pair of six points, some of which are coloured in red ink and some of which are in blue ink.

			<br />
			Consider the segments AB, AC, AD, AE, AF joining A to the remaining points. Atleast three of them are of the same colour. Let us say, for the sake of argument, that AB, AC, AD are all red. If atleast one of the segments BC, CD, BD (say BC) is red, then the points A, B, C are all joined by red lines. In case BC, CD, BD are all blue, then the points B, C, D are all joined by blue lines.
