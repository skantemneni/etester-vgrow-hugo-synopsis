	<h3 class="skill-heading">Asexual Reproduction</h3>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Introduction</span>
		<br />
		All living organisms have an instinct to live their own lives and then survive through their generation.Living things take birth, grow old and die. Before death individuals give birth to the off springs(children) to continue their race. Have you ever provoked you mind to know the <span class="highlight01">process</span> that leads to off springs? The answer is right here ... This survival instinct is helped by the process of Reproduction.
		<span class="highlight01">Giving birth to off springs, which are similar to parents, is known as reproduction</span>.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Importance of Reproduction </span>
		<br />
		Reproduction is one of the most important characteristics of life. Reproduction is the creation of new life of its own kind. Reproduction is essential for the continuation of species. A species will disappear from the face of the earth if it does not reproduce. Reproduction takes place in both, plants and animals.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Types of reproduction</span>
		<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Asexual Reproduction:</span>
		<br />
		In asexual reproduction, a single parent gives rise to new individuals. Binary fission in Amoeba and Budding in Hydra are Asexual reproductions. <br />
		<span class="highlight01">The production of a new organism from  a single parent without the involvement of sex cells (or gametes) is called asexual reproduction.</span>
		<br />
		It is called asexual reproduction because it does not use special cells called 'sex cells' (or gametes) for producing a new organism. In <span class="highlight01">asexual reproduction,</span> a part of the parent organism <span class="highlight01">separates off and grows</span> into a new organism. Thus, in asexual reproduction, only one parent is needed to produce a new organism. But no sex cells are involved in asexual reproduction.</p>

		<span class="highlight01">Sexual Reproduction</span>
		<br />
		In <span class="highlight01">Sexual Reproduction</span> the offspring arises from two parents of different sexes: male sex and a female sex. The male parent contains male sex cells (or male gametes) and the female parent contains female sex cells (or female gametes). <br />
		The production of a new organism from two parents by making use of their sex cells (or gametes) is called <span class="highlight01">Sexual Reproduction</span>
		<br />
		In sexual reproduction, <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( Male Gamete + Female Gamete \rightarrow Zygote \rightarrow New organism  \) </span>
		<br />
		Our father is a male and our mother is a female. The male and female parents have special organs in them which produce male sex cells and female sex cells respectively. The humans, fish, frogs, hens, cats, dogs, cows, horses, deer, rabbits, lions and tigers all reproduce by the method of sexual reproduction. Most of the flowering plants also reproduce by sexual reproduction. <br />
		<span class="highlight01">Basic differences between sexual and asexual reproductions </span>
		<br />
		The basic difference between asexual and sexual reproduction is that only one parent is needed in asexual reproduction whereas two parents are needed in sexual reproduction. Another difference is that no sex cells (or gametes) are involved in asexual reproduction but sex cells (or gametes) take part in sexual reproduction. We will now study the asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction in detail, one by one. Let us start with asexual reproduction.</p>

<section class="skill" id="02">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Asexual Reproduction</h3>
	<p>In the asexual reproduction method, certain body cells of the parent organism undergo repeated mitotic cell divisions to form two (or more) new organisms of the same kind. Asexual reproduction takes place by six different methods. These are:</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">

	</div>
	<p>We will now describe all these methods of asexual reproduction in detail, one by one. Let us start with fission.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Fission</h4>
		<p>In the asexual reproduction method, certain body cells of the parent organism undergo repeated mitotic cell divisions to form two (or more) new organisms of the same kind. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Fission is the process of reproduction in unicellular organism such as protozoa.</span> In the process of fission, a unicellular organism splits (or divides) to form two (or more) new organisms. Fission is of two types: <span class="highlight01">Binary fission </span> and <span class="highlight01">Multiple fission</span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Binary fission</h5>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">In binary fission, the parent organism splits(or divides) to form TWO new orgasms. </span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Examples:</span>
			<br />
			Amoeba, Paramecium, Leishmania </p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Binary Fission in Amoeba</span>
			<br />
			Amoeba reproduces by binary fission by dividing its body into two parts. This happens as follows: When the Amoeba cell has reached its maximum size of growth, then first the nucleus of Amoeba lengthens and divides into two parts. After that the cytoplasm of Amoeba divides into two parts, one part around each nucleus. In this way, one parent Amoeba divides to form two smaller Amoebae (called daughter Amoebae). And we say that one Amoeba produces two Amoebae.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>The two daughter Amoebae produced here grow to their full size by eating food and then divide again to produce four Amoebae, and so on. In the unicellular organisms such as Amoeba, the splitting of the parent cell during fission (or cell division) can take place in any plane.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Binary Fission in Paramecium</span>
			<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Paramecium</span> is a unicellular animal having short thread-like structures called cilia over its surface. Paramecium also reproduces by the method of <span class="highlight01">Binary Fission.</span> A fully grown Paramecium divides its body into two parts to form <span class="highlight01">two smaller Paramecia.</span>
		</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-2.png" alt="image2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Binary Fission in Leishmania</span>
			<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Leishmania</span> Leishmania is a unicellular protozoan. It is a parasite which causes the disease known as kala-azar (or black fever). Kala-azar is also known as leishmaniasis. Leishmania has a greater degree of organisation in its body, having a whip-like structure called <span class="highlight01">flagellum</span> at its one end. In Leishmania, the splitting of parent cell during fission(or cell division)takes place in a definite plane (longitudinally) with respect to flagellum at its end.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Multiple Fission</h5>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">In Multiple fission, the parent organism splits (or divides) to form many new organisms attire same time.</span>
			<br />
			Sometimes, a cyst or protective wall is formed around the cell of a single-celled organism (like that of Plasmodium) Inside the cyst, <span class="highlight01">the nucleus of cell splits </span> several times to form many smaller nuclei called <span class="highlight01">daughter nuclei.</span> Cytoplasm collect around each daughter nuclei and thin membranes are formed around them. Many new <span class="highlight01">daughter cells</span> are formed from a single parent cell within the cyst. When the favourable conditions arrive, the cyst breaks open and the many daughter cells present in it are released, each forming a new organism</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-3.png" alt="image3" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>Plasmodium is a protozoan which reproduces by the asexual method of multiple fission. About 1000 daughter cells are produced by the multiple fission of one Plasmodium cell. Plasmodium is the malarial parasite which produces malaria disease in human beings. Plasmodium is carried by female Anopheles mosquitoes from one person to another .</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Budding</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">In budding, a small part of the body of the parent organism grows out as a 'bud' which then detaches and becomes a new organism.</span>
			<br />
			The asexual reproduction by budding is observed in Hydra and yeast.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Budding in Hydra</h5>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Hydra is a multicellular organism with a soft cylindrical body.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It bears tentacles surrounding its mouth towards the top.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>For reproduction by budding, one or more buds bulge from its lateral sides.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Each bud grows into a baby hydra. an independent hydra.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Baby hydra separates out from the parent forming</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-5.png" alt="image5" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Budding in yeast</h5>
		<p>Yeast is tiny, unicellular, non-green plant (which is a fungus). <br />
			Yeast reproduces by budding. The Figure below shows a parent yeast cell (which is a complete plant). In yeast, first a bud appears on the outside of the cell wall</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-6.png" alt="image6" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>The nucleus of parent yeast cell then divides into two parts and one part of the nucleus moves into the bud. Ultimately, the bud separates off from the parent yeast cell and forms a new yeast cell (or new yeast plant). The budding in yeast, however, often takes place so fast that the first buds start forming their own buds and all of them remain attached to the parent yeast 11 forming a chain of yeast cells. After some time, all the yeast cells of the chain separate torn one another and form individual yeast plants</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Noteworthy Points</span>
			<br />
			Note the formation of buds on the yeast cells and how they separate from the parent cell. In some organisms like sponges and corals, the buds remain attached to the parent organism permanently. These buds then grow and produce buds of their own. In this way, a colony of sponges or corals is formed.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Spore Formation</h4>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-7.png" alt="image7" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>Spore formation is the asexual method of reproduction. The reproduction by spore formation takes place in plants. In spore formation, the parent plant produces hundreds of microscopic reproductive units called <span class="highlight01">'spores'.</span> When the spore case of the plant bursts, then the spores spread into air. When these air-borne spores land on food under favourable conditions, they germinate and produce new plants.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Examples</span>
			<br />
			The tiny spores of <span class="highlight01">bread mould</span>  (a fungus plant) are almost always present in the air. If we keep a <span class="highlight01">moist slice of bread</span> aside for a few days, then the spores of bread mould plant present in air settle on the moist bread and germinate to form new fungus plants. The <span class="highlight01">bread mould</span> plants first look like a white cottony mass covering the bread slice which later on turns <span class="highlight01">black.</span> If we observe the surface of this slice of bread through a magnifying glass, then the <span class="highlight01">bread mould</span> plant growing on it will appear to be like that shown. </p>

		<div class="list1-ul default-spaced-indented list-bullet-style-image-square">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>The common bread mould plant consists of fine, thread-like projections called hyphae and thin stems having <span class="highlight01">knob- like</span> structures called <span class="highlight01">sporangia.</span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Each <span class="highlight01">knob- like</span> structure (or sporangium) contains hundreds of minute spores enclosed in a <span class="highlight01">spore case.</span> When the <span class="highlight01">spore case bursts.</span> the tiny spores are dispersed in air.</p>

		 </div>
		<p>As complex multicellular organisms have a very high degree of organisation in their body, they cannot be reproduced from their cut body parts by the process of regeneration. A dog is a <span class="highlight01">complex</span> multicellular organism which cannot be regenerated from its cut body part say, a cut tail. This is because the cells present in the cut tail of a dog cannot produce dog's organs like <span class="highlight01">heart, brain, lungs, stomach, intestines and limbs, </span> etc, needed for the making of a complete dog. The complex multicellular organisms need more complex ways of reproduction like <span class="highlight01">sexual reproduction.</span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Fragmentation</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">The breaking up of the body of a simple multicellular organism into two (or more) pieces on maturing each of which subsequently grows to form a complete new oTanism is called fragmentation.</span>
			<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Examples:</span>
			<br />
			Spirogyra and sea anemones reproduces by fragmentation. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Fragmentation in Spirogyra</h5>
		<p>Spirogyra is a <span class="highlight01">green, filamentous alga plant </span> which is found in ponds, lakes and slow moving streams. Spirogyra filament simply breaks into two or more fragments on maturation, and each fragment then grows into a new Spirogyra. </p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-11.png" alt="image11" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>This breakup of the filament of a mature Spirogyra on its own brings about asexual reproduction.Thus, Spirogyra reproduces by the asexual method of fragmentation.</p>
		<span class="highlight01">Note:</span>
		<p>A mature spirogyra produces three new spirogyra. Both fission and fragmentation are asexual and in both splitting take place. Then why not they are same or what is the difference between them? In fission, a unicellular organism breaks up to form two (Or more) daughter organisms, whereas in fragmentation, a multicellular organism breaks up to form two (or more) daughter organisms.</p>

		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Vegetative propagation in grass</h5>

				<li>
					<p>Many plants like strawberry and raspberry are propagated by the natural layering method.</p>

				<li>
					<p>First, the stem(or branch) is removed from the plant chosen to be made scion(for its desirable characteristics) by making a slanting cut.</p>
					<div class="synopsis-image">

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The cut surfaces of the scion and stock are fitted together and bound tightly with a piece of cloth and covered properly with polythene sheet (so as to prevent harmful infection by bacteria or fungus, and loss of water and plant sap from the cut and joined ends of stock and scion) </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>While joining the scion to the stock, care should be taken to make sure that the <span class="highlight01">cambium layer of</span> scion is in contact with the cambium layer of stock (because the cambium l	th layer in stem is responsible for growth).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The cut soon heals and the stock and scion of two plants grow together and become one plant. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The scion continues to produce its original leaves, flowers and fruits but it gets water and minerals for making food from the chosen stock. So, the fruits will have the characteristics o: both the plants (from which scion and stock have come).</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Do Organisms Create Exact Copies of Themselves in Asexual Reproduction</h4>
		<p>Asexual reproduction usually results in the production of genetically identical offsprings, the only genetic variation arises as a result of occasional inaccuracies in DNA replication(or DNA copying) at the time of cell division.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Why are the offsprings identical?</span>
		</p>
		<div class="list1-ul default-spaced-indented list-bullet-style-image-square">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>The material which carries genetic information from the parents to the offsprings is DNA-Deoxyibo Nucleic Acid (which is present in the form of chromosomes in the nuclei of all the cells).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The basis of asexual reproduction is mitosis. This is the division of a nucleus into two identical daughter nuclei.</p>
				</li>
				<div class="synopsis-image">

				<li>
					<p>Each daughter nucleus has the same genetic make up because of the replication of DNA Of copying of DNA) of the parent cell.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>After the division of the nucleus, the rest of parent cell divides to form two genetically identical daughter cells. The daughter cells can then form two offsprings. From this conclude that all the offsprings produced by one parent as a result of asexual reproduction are usually genetically identical.</p>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The clones possess exact copies of the DNA (or genes) of their parent and hence show remarkable similarity to the parent and to one another.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The clones of plants can be produced by the asexual methods of reproduction such as cutting, layering, grafting, tissue culture, etc.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>These days techniques have been developed to clone even in animals. Dolly, the sheep hit the headlines in 1997 as the first successfully produced animal clone.</p>

		</p>
		<div class="list1-ul default-spaced-indented list-bullet-style-image-square">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>The replication (or copying) of DNA in the cell is done by certain biochemical reactions which synthesize more of genetic material. No biochemical reaction can reproduce 100 per cent same results.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>When the DNA already present in the nucleus of the parent cell is replicated (or copied) by making more DNA at the time of asexual reproduction, then slight variations come in the two copies formed.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Due to this, the two DNA molecules formed by replication will be similar but may not be exactly identical to the original DNA. These slight variations in the replication of DNA molecule will lead to slight variations in the offsprings produced by asexual reproduction.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Although the offsprings produced by asexual reproduction are said to be genetically the same as the parent organism, but still they have occasional variations. This means that the organisms do not always create exact copies of themselves in asexual reproduction.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is to be noted that the importance of DNA copying in asexual reproduction is that the characteristics of the parent organisms are transmitted to its offsprings and at the same time some occasional variations are also produced in the offsprings.</p>

						The following discussion make it clear.</p>

				<li>
					<p>There may be some drastic changes like excessive heat or cold or shortage of water (drought), etc., in the habitat of a species of organisms.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If all the organisms of a population living in that habitat are exactly identical, then there is danger that all of them may die and no one would survive under those conditions.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>This will eliminate the species from that habitat completely. However, if some variations are present in some individual organisms to tolerate excessive heat or cold or survive on meagre water supply, then there is a chance for them to survive and fluorish even in adverse environment.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In this way, the introduction of variations during reproduction provides stability to the populations of various species by preventing them from getting wiped out during adverse conditions.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>For example, if there is a population of certain bacteria living in temperate water (which is neither very hot nor very cold) and the temperature of water increases too much due to global warming, then most of these bacteria will not be able to tolerate excessive heat and hence die.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Sexual Reproduction</h3>
	<p>Sexual reproduction takes place by the combination of special reproductive cells called <span class="highlight01">sex cells.</span> Sex cells are of two types: male sex cells and female sex cells. The sex cells are commonly known as <span class="highlight01">gametes.</span> Gametes are of two types: male gametes and female gametes. In sexual reproduction, a male gamete fuses with a female gamete to form a new cell called <span class="highlight01">zygote.</span> This zygote then grows and develops into a new organism in due course of time. It is to noted that the sex cells or gametes are also sometimes called germ cells.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants</h4>
		<p>The plants in which the sex organs are carried within the flowers and the seeds are enclosed in a fruit are called <span class="highlight01">angiosperms.</span> Angiosperms are commonly known as flowering plants. The flowering plants reproduce by sexual reproduction method.The sex organs (or reproductive organs) of a plant are in its flowers.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-20.png" alt="image20" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>other words, flowers contain the sexual reproductive organs of a plant figure . In most of the plants, the same flower contains the male organ as well as the female organ. In other words, the majority of plants are bisexual having the male and female reproductive organs in the same plant (or same flower). In fact, the reproductive part of higher plants is the flower. The function of a flower is to make male and female gametes and to ensure that fertilisation will take place to make new seeds for the reproduction of plant (see the above Figures). Sexual reproduction is the most common method of reproduction in flowering plants. From all this discussion we conclude that flowers are for sexual reproduction in plants. A flower makes both male and female gametes needed for sexual reproduction in plants.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">The sexual reproduction in plants takes place in the following steps:</span>
		</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>The male organ of flower called 'stamen' makes the male gametes (male sex cells) of the plant.<br />
						These male gametes are present in pollen grains.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The female organ of a flower called 'carpel' makes the female gametes (female sex cells) of the plant. These female gametes are present in ovules. The female gametes present in ovules are also called 'ova', 'egg cells' or just 'eggs'.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The male gametes present in pollen grains fertilise the female gametes or egg cells present in ovules.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The fertilised egg cells grow within ovules and become seeds.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The seeds produce new plants on germination (under suitable conditions light, etc.).<br />
						We will now describe the various parts of a flower including the sexual then we will discuss the sexual reproduction in plants in detail.<br />
						The main parts of a flower are: Receptacle, Sepals, Petals, Stamen and of a flower are shown in Figure.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Receptacle:</h5>
		<p>The base of a flower to which all the parts of a flower are attached is called receptacle.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-21.png" alt="image21" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Sepals:</h5>
		<p>The green, leaf-like parts in the outermost circle of a flower are called sepals . All the sepals taken together are called calyx.The function of sepals (or calyx) is to protect the flower in its initial stages when it is in the form of a bud.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Petals:</h5>
		<p>The colourful parts of a flower are called petals . The petals lie inside the sepals.All the petals taken together are called <span class="highlight01">corolla.</span> The petals are usually scented. The function of petals (or corolla) is to attract insects (for pollination) and to protect the reproductive organs which are at the centre of the flower.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Stamen:</h5>
		<p>The little stalks with swollen tops just inside the ring of petals in a flower are called stamens. Stamen is the male reproductive organ of the plant.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-22.png" alt="image22" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>Stamen produces pollen grains. The stamen is made of two parts:	a filament and an anther.The stalk of stamen is called filament and the swollen top of stamen is called <span class="highlight01">anther.</span> It is actually the anther of a stamen which makes the pollen grains and stores them (The pollen grains appear to be yellow, powder-like substance to us) Pollen grains contain the male gametes (or male sex cells) of the plant.It is clear from this discussion that the male garmetes of a plant are made in the anther of stamen. Another point to be noted is that a flower usually has a numb er of stamens in it.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Carpel:</h5>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-23.png" alt="image23" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>In the centre of a flower, there is a flask-shaped organ called carpel. Carpel is the female reproductive organ of the plant. A carpel is made of three parts: stigma, style and ovary . The top part of carpel is called stigma. Stigma is for receiving the pollen grains from the anther of stamen (during pollination). Stigma is sticky so that pollen can stick to it. The middle part of carpel is called <span class="highlight01">style.</span> Style is a tube which connects stigma to the ovary. The swollen part at the bottom of a carpel is called ovary . The ovary makes ovules and stores them. Ovules contain the female gametes (or female sex cells) of the plant. There are usually many ovules the ovary. Each ovule contains only one female gamete of the plant. The female gamete -T female sex cell of the plant which is present inside the ovule is called urn' or 'egg'. <br />
			It is clear from this discussion that the female gametes of a plant are made in the ovary of carpel. <br />
			Please note that the female organ of a plant is known by two names : carpel and pistil. Another point to be noted is that the female organ called carpel is surrounded by a number of male organs called stamens in the flower .<br />
			The flowers which contain only one sex organ, either stamens or arpels, are called unisexual flowers. The flowers of papaya and watermelon plants are unisexual flowers.On the other hand, the flowers which contain both the sex organs, stamens as well as carpel, are called bisexual flowers. The flowers of Hibiscus and mustard plants are bisexual flowers.A new seed of the plant is formed when the male gamete present in a pollen grain unites with the female gamete present in the ovule. This happens in two steps: pollination and fertilisation.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Pollination</h4>
		<p>For the male gamete to be able to combine with the female gamete, it is necessary that first the pollen grains from the anther of stamen should be carried to the stigma of carpel. <br />
			The transfer of pollen grains from the anther of a stamen to the stigma of a carpel is called pollination. Thus, pollination is said to take place when pollen grains are carried from the anther to the stigma of the flower.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-24.png" alt="image24" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>Pollination is done by insects (like bees and butterflies), birds, wind, and water. Pollination can occur in two ways: self-pollination and cross-pollination.When the pollen grains from the anther of a flower are transferred to the stigma of the same flower (or another flower on the same plant), it is called self-pollination. When the pollen grains from the anther of a flower on one plant are transferred to the stigma of a flower on another similar plant, it is called cross-pollination. Insects help in cross-pollination as follows:</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-25.png" alt="image25" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>When an insect sits on the flower of a plant for sucking nectar, then the pollen grains from the anther of this flower stick to its body. And when this insect now sits on another flower of another similar plant, then the pollen grains sticking to its body are transferred to the stigma of this second flower .In this way the insect transfers the pollen grains from the anther of flower in one plant to the stigma of flower in another plant and causes cross-pollination. The blowing wind also carries pollen grains from one flower to another flower and helps in cross pollination .</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Fertilisation</h4>
		<p>After a pollen grain falls on the stigma, the next step is fertilisation. Fertilisation occurs when the ma gamete present in pollen grain joins with the female gamete (or egg) present in ovule.<br />
			This happens follows. When a pollen grain falls on the stigma of the carpel, it bursts open and grows a pollen downwards through the style towards the female gamete in the ovary .</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-26.png" alt="image26" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>A male gamete moves down the pollen tube. The pollen tube enters the ovule in the ovary . The tip of pollen tube bursts open and male gamete comes out of pollen tube.<br />
			In ovary, the male gamete of pollen combines with the nucleus of female gamete or egg present in ovule to form a fertilised egg (called zygote) . <br />
			And we say that fertilisation has taken place.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Formation of Fruits and Seeds</span>
			<br />
			The fertilised egg (or zygote) divides several times to form an embryo within the ovule. <br />
			The ovule develops a tough coat around it and is gradually converted into a seed (containing the baby plant). <br />
			In fact, all the eggs in the ovules present in the ovary of a flower get fertilised by male gametes from pollen grains and grow to become seeds. <br />
			The ovary of flower develops and becomes a fruit (with seeds inside it). <br />
			The other parts of flower like sepals, petals, stamens, stigma and style dry up and fall off. Only the ovary is left behind.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-27.png" alt="image27" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>So, at the place on plant where we had a flower originally, we now have a fruit (which is the ovary of the flower containing seeds). A fruit protects the seeds. <br />
			Some fruits are soft, sweet and jucy like mangoes and oranges. But some fruits are hard, dry and woody like the peanuts and almonds, etc. <br />
			A seed is the reproductive unit of a plant (which can be used to grow a new plant). The seed contains a baby plant (or embryo) and food for the baby plant. </p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-28.png" alt="image28" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>The part of baby plant in seed which develops into shoot with leaves is called plumule and the part which develops into root is called radicle. The part of seed which contains stored food for the baby plant is called cotyledon. The wheat grains, gram iima), corn, peas, and beans, are all seeds. The baby plant present inside a seed is in the active state (called dormant state).</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-29.png" alt="image29" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>When the seed gets suitable conditions like water, air and warmth etc., it germinates and a new plant grows out of the seed. <br />
			In this way, the parent plant reproduces more plants like itself by forming seeds through flowers. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Germination of Seeds</span>
			<br />
			The seeds obtained from a plant are usually very dry. In this dry state, the seeds can remain alive	but inactive for long periods. They are said to be dormant. When a seed gets water, air and	warmth, etc., it  begins to grow. When a seed begins to grow, it is said to germinate. Thus, the beginning of the growth of seeds is called germination of seeds. Germination begins when the seed absorbs water, swells and bursts through the seed coat. The water helps the enzymes to function in the seed. The enzymes digest the stored rood in cotyledons and make it soluble. This soluble food makes the radicle and plumule present in the seed to grow. The germination of a bean seed is shown in Figure. The radical of the seed grows first to form the root. <br />
			The root pushes down into the soil and begins to absorb water and minerals from the soil. After this the plumage grows upwards to form the shoot . The shoot and root grow further . When the shoot comes up above the ground, it develops green leaves . The green leaves of the shoot begin to synthesis own food in the presence of sunlight. This seedling grows gradually and ultimately becomes a new plant.</p>

	 </div>
	<p>In order to understand sexual reproduction, we should know the meanings of some important terms like male sex, female sex, gametes, sperms, ova (or eggs), fertilisation, zygote and embryo, which are involved in sexual reprodueLion.These are discussed below:</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Male and Female</span>
		<br />
		A man is said to have male sex and a woman is said to have female sex. Similarly, a boy has a male sex and a girl has a female sex. An animal having male sex cells called 'sperms' in its body is called male. <br />
		On the other hand, an animal having female sex cells called `ova' (or 'eggs') in its body is called female. <br />
		We will now discuss gametes.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Gametes</span>
		<br />
		The cells involved in sexual reproduction are called gametes. In other words, gametes are the sexual reproductive cells (or sex cells). Gametes are of two types: male gametes, and female gametes. The male gamete in animals is called 'sperm' and the female gamete in animals is called 'ovum' or 'egg'.<br />
		Sperms and ova (or eggs) are extremely small cells which can be seen only with the help of a high power microscope.Please note that a female gamete (or female sex cell) is usually known by two names: ovum and egg. So, whether we use the term 'ovum' or 'egg', it will mean the same thing.Another point to be noted is that the plural of ovum is ova. The ovum or egg contains water and stored food. <br />
		The important part of ovum or egg is its nucleus . The sperm cell is hundreds or even thousands of times smaller than the ovum or egg and it has a long tail. The sperms are motile which can move independently with the help of their tails. The nuclei of the sperm and ovum contain chromosomes which carry the genes. It is clear from the above discussion that sperms are the male gametes of animals. And ova are the female gametes of animals. In other words, sperms are the male sex cells of animals and ova are the female sex cells of the animals.As we will study after a short while, fusion of gametes gives rise to a single cell called zygote. <br />
		We can also say that the cell which is formed by the fusion of a male gamete and a female gamete is called zygote. In most simple words, zygote is a 'fertilised ovum' or 'fertilised egg'. All the multi-cellular animals start their life from a single cell called zygote through sexual reproduction.The process of fusion of gametes is called fertilisation. This is discussed below.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Fertilisation</span>
		<br />
		For sexual reproduction to occur, a male gamete must combine with a female gamete.The fusion of a male gamete with a female gamete to form a zygote during the sexual reproduction, is called fertilisation. Since the male gamete of an animal is called sperm and the female gamete of an animal is called ovum, therefore, we can also say that: The fusion of a sperm with an ovum to form a zygote during sexual reproduction, is called fertilisation. It is clear that the process of fertilisation produces a new cell called zygote. The zygote is actually 'fertilised ovum' or 'fertilised egg'. The zygote grows and develops to form a new baby.The unborn baby in the uterus in the early stages of development is called an <span class="highlight01">embryo.</span> On the other hand, the unborn baby in the uterus in the later stages of development is called a foetus.</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="104590004_image-32.png" alt="image32" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Internal and External Fertilisation</span>
		<br />
		We have just studied that the fusion of a sperm with an ovum is called fertilisation.Now, the ovum is made in the body of the female animal.So, the fertilisation of an egg by a sperm can take place either inside the body of the female animal or outside its body. This leads to two modes of fertilisation in animals: internal fertilisation and external fertilisation. The fertilisation which occurs inside the female body is called internal fertilisation.In internal fertilisation, the female animal's eggs are fertilised by sperms inside her body. In mammals , birds and reptiles, the fertilisation occurs inside the female body <br />
		In other words, internal fertilisation takes place in mammals , birds and reptiles. In internal fertilisation, the male animal puts his sperms into the female animal's body. This transfer of sperms from the testes c: the male animal into female animal's body occurs at the time of <span class="highlight01">copulation</span>.<br />
		Copulation is the act by which the male animal transfers his sperms into the female animal's bod y.During copulation, very large number of sperms are discharged into the female body.These sperms fertilise the eggs inside he: body. For example, during copulation a man puts his sperms inside a woman's body through an orgar. called penis. These sperms then fertilise the egg inside the woman's body So, this is a case of internal fertilisation.The fertilisation which occurs outside. the female body is called external fertilisation. In external fertilisation, the female animal's eggs are fertilised by sperms outside its body. In amphibians and fishes, the fertilisation of eggs occurs outside the female animal's body. In other words, in amphibians and fishes, external fertilisation takes place.<br />
		In external fertilisation, the male and female animals release their sperms and eggs in water where fertilisation takes place by collisions between sperms and eggs. For example, the males and females of frogs and fishes release their  sperms and eggs in water in which they live. The sperms then collide with the eggs and fertilise them outside the leads to fertilisation. This is an example of external fertilisation, body of female frog or fish. <br />
		The fertilisation in humans, cats, dogs and birds are the examples of internal fertilisation. The fertilisation in frogs and fishes are the examples of external fertilisation. We know that the new cell which is formed by fertilisation is called 'zygote'. <br />
		And this zygote then grows and develops into a full organism (or baby animal). The method in which a zygote grows and develops into a full organism also varies in different animals. <br />
		For example, in human beings the zygote grows and develops into a baby inside the female body .And then the mother gives birth. to the baby. Just like humans, the animals like cats and dogs also give birth to their young ones. But the process is entirely different in the animals which lay eggs.For example, a hen sits on its fertilised eggs for a considerable time to give them warmth. During this period, the zygote grows and develops to form a complete chick. This chick then comes out of the egg by breaking its shell. It is clear from this discussion that all the organisms do not give birth to individuals like humans do.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">The Advantages of Sexual Reproduction</span>
		<br />
		The sexual reproduction has many advantages over asexual reproduction. In asexual reproduction, the off springs are almost identical to their parent because they have the same genes as their parent. So, much genetic variation is not possible in asexual reproduction. <br />
		This is a disadvantage of asexual reproduction because it inhibits the further evolution of the organism. In sexual reproduction the off springs, although similar to their parents, are not identical to them or to one another. This is because the of springs receive some genes from the mother and some from the father. Because of the mixing of genes of mother and father in various different combinations, all the offsprings ave genetic variations. In this way, sexual reproduction leads to a greater variety in population. <br />
		This means that a species can adapt more quickly to changes in its surroundings. This is because there are always likely to be some individuals which are more suited to the changes than others, and these individuals will survive and reproduce themselves. From the above discussion we conclude that sexual reproduction promotes diversity of characters in the offsprings by providing genetic variation. Sexual reproduction plays an important role in the origin of new species having different characteristics. This genetic variation leads to the continuous evolution of various species to form better and still better organisms. All this is not possible in the case of asexual reproduction</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Why the Amount of DNA Does Not Get Doubled During Sexual Reproduction</span>
		<br />
		In sexual reproduction, though the genetic material DNA from two gametes, male and female gemetes, combines together to form a new cell 'zygote' but the amount of DNA m zygote does not get doubled. This can be explained as follows: The gametes are special type of cells called reproductive cells which contain in only half the amount of DNA as compared to the normal body cells of an organism. <br />
		So, when a male gamete combines with a female gamete during sexual reproduction, then the new cell 'zygote' will have the normal amount of DNA (or normal number of chromosomes in it). For example, the human sperm has 23 chromosomes and the human egg has also 23 chromosomes. So, when a sperm and an egg fuse together during fertilisation, then the zygote formed will have 23 + 23 = 46 chromosomes, which is the normal number of chromosomes.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">How Sexual Reproduction in Animals Takes Place</span>
		<br />
		Sexual reproduction is the most common method of reproduction in animals. <br />
		The sexual reproduction in animals takes place in the following steps :</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>The male parent produces male gametes called sperms. The sperm is a small cell with a long tail for movement .</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The female parent produces female gametes called ova . The ovum is a much bigger cell than the sperm, having a lot of cytoplasm .</p>
				<div class="synopsis-image"> 
					<img src="104590004_image-33.png" alt="image33" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
				 </div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The sperm enters into the ovum and fuses with it to form a new cell called 'zygote'. This process is called fertilisation. So, the zygote is a fertilised ovum.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The zygote then divides again and again to form a large number of cells (all of which remain together And ultimately zygote grows and develops to become a new baby. From the above discussion we conclude that the whole process of sexual reproduction in animals involves the formation of sperms and eggs; joining together of sperm and egg to form a zygote; and then the growth and development of zygote to form a baby animal. <br />
					In complex multicellular animals there are special reproductive organs to make sperms and eggs; to bring together sperms and eggs for fertilisation; and for the growth and development of zygote into a baby. <br />
					We will study all this in the human reproductive system. <br />
					Before we describe the human reproductive system, we should; know the meaning of the term 'puberty'. This is discussed below.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Puberty</span>
		<br />
		When a child is small, sometimes it becomes difficult to tell from appearance whether it is a boy or 3 girl. This is because small boys and girls have the same body shape. A time of rapid growth. and body changes starts in the early teens which makes the boy and the girl appear different and also behave differently . These changes start earlier in girls than in boys. We call the time between childhood and <span class="highlight01">adulthood 'adolescence'</span> The production of male and female <span class="highlight01">'sex hormones'</span> in the bodies of boys and girls increases dramatically at this stage and causes a wide-ranging changes in their bodies. <br />
		The testes and ovaries make different hormones, so the boys and girls develop in different ways. Ultimately the boys and girls become sexually mature and their reproductive systems start functioning. <br />
		<span class="highlight01">The age at which the sex hormones begin to be produced and the boy and girl become sexually mature is called puberty. </span> Puberty tends to start earlier in females than in males. <br />
		Generally boys attain puberty at the age of 13 to 14 years while girls reach puberty at a comparatively lower age of 10 to 12 years. On attaining puberty, the male gonads called testes start producing male gametes called sperms and the female gonads called ovaries start producing female gametes called ova. In addition to producing sex cells male and female gonads also produce and secrete sex hormones with the onset of puberty. <br />
		The testes produce the male sex hormone called testosterone, and the ovaries produce two female sex hormones, <span class="highlight01">oestrogen and progesterone.</span> The sex hormones play an important role in the process of reproduction because they make the reproductive organs to mature and start functioning. Puberty is the age at which the reproductive organs reach maturity and secondary sexual characteristics develop. <br />
		The various changes which occur in boys at puberty are : Hair grow under armpits and in pubic regions between the thighs.Hair also grow on other parts of the body like chest and face . Body	becomes more muscular due to the development of muscles. The voice deepens. Chest and shoulders broaden.<br />
		The penis and testes become larger. The testes start to make sperms. Feelings and sexual drives with adulthood begin to develop. All these changes in boys are brought about by the male sex hormone 'testosterone' made in testes. <br />
		The various changes which occur in girls at puberty are: Hair grow under armpits and pubic region This change is the same as in boys). Mammary glands develop and enlarge. The hips broaden. Extra fat is deposited in various parts of the body like hips and thighs. Fallopian tubes, uterus and vagina enlarge. Ovaries start to release eggs. Menstruation start. Feelings and sexual drives associated with adulthood begin to develop. All these changes in girls are brought about the female sex hormones 'oestrogen' and 'progesterone' made in ovaries. It is to be noted that the hormone 'oestrogen' is also written and spoken as 'estrogen'.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Human Reproductive System,</span>
		<br />
		The humans use sexual mode of reproduction. The organs associated with the process of reproduction nin human males and human females are different, so the reproductive systems in males and females are different which are known as male reproductive system and female reproductive system, respectively. The reproductive systems in human beings become functional at a definite age called puberty. We will now describe the human male reproductive system and female reproductive system in detail, one by one.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Male Reproductive System</h4>
		<p>The human male reproductive system consists of the following organs: Testes, Scrotum, Epididymis, Vas deferens or Sperm duct, Seminal vesicles, Prostrate gland and Penis. The human male reproductive system is shown in Figure .Scince the human male is called man, so we can also say that is the reproductive system of man.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-34.png" alt="image34" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Testes </span> are the oval shaped organs which lie outside the abdominal cavity of a man. A man has two testes. Testes are the primary reproductive organs in males.The function of testes is to make the male sex cells called <span class="highlight01">sperms </span> and	also to make the male sex hormone called testosterone. It is noted that the testes of a man make the sex gametes from puberty onwards, throughout his life. <br />
			The testes of a man lie in small muscular pouch called scrotum. The male reproductive outside the abdominal Penis cavity . The testes are outside the abdominal cavity of the body, because the sperm formation requires a lower temperature than the normal body temperature. <br />
			Being outside the abdominal cavity, the temperature of scrotum is about 3°C lower than the temperature inside the body. In this way, the testes provide an optimal temperature for the formation of sperms. <br />
			The sperms formed in testes come out and go into a coiled tube called epididymis . The sperms get stored temporarily in epididymis. From epididymis, the .sperms are carried by a long tube called vas deferens which joins with another tube called urethra coming from the bladder. <br />
			Along the path of vas deferens, the glands called seminal vesicles and prostrate gland add their secretions to sperms so that the sperms are now in a liquid. This liquid plus the sperms it contains is called <span class="highlight01">semen</span>. The secretions of seminal vesicles and prostrate gland provide nutrition to the sperms and also make their further transport easier.Urethra forms a common passage for sperms and urine. Urethra carries the sperms to an organ called penis which opens outside the body. The penis passes the sperms from the man's body into vagina in the woman's body during mating for the purpose of reproduction. It is to noted that in male there is only one opening for the urine and sperms to pass out of the body.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Female Reproductive System</h4>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590004_image-35.png" alt="image35" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>The human female reproductive system consists of the following organs: Ovaries, Oviducts , Uterus, and Vagina. The human female reproductive system is shown in Figure. Since the human female is called woman, so we can also say that it is the reproductive system of woman. <br />
			Ovaries are the oval shaped organs which are inside the abdominal cavity of a woman near the kidneys. A woman has two ovaries. Ovaries are the primary reproductive organs in a woman . The function of ovaries is to make mature female sex cells called 'ova' or 'eggs', and also to make the female sex hormones . <br />
			Each ovary is composed of several thousand <span class="highlight01">follicles.</span> At puberty these follicles mature to form the ripe eggs or ripe ova. Just above the ovaries are the tubes called <span class="highlight01">oviducts.</span>
			<br />
			The oviducts are not directly connected to ovaries but have funnel shaped openings which almost cover the ovaries .The ovum released by an ovary goes into the oviduct through its funnel-shaped opening. The fertilisation of egg by a sperm takes place in the oviduct. The two oviducts connect to a bag like organ called uterus at their other ends .The growth and development of a fertilised ovum into a baby takes place in the <span class="highlight01">uterus</span> The  uterus is connected through a narrow opening called cervix to another tube called vagina which opens to the outside of the body. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Vagina</span> receives the penis for putting sperms into the woman's body. Vagina is a tubular structure.Vagina is also called 'birth canal' because it is through this passage that the baby is born after development inside the uterus of the mother. Please note that in female the opening for passing out urine the completion of and the vaginal opening are separate. It is obvious from the above discussion that the female reproductive system in humans is more complex than that of the male reproductive system. The complexity in structure and function of the female reproductive system is necessary for the union of sperms and ovum inside the female body and the development of the baby in the mother's uterus.</p>

<section class="skill" id="05">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Fertilisation and Embryo Development</h3>
	<p>In human beings, internal fertilisation takes place. The sperms made in the testes of man are introduced into the vagina of the woman through penis during copulation. In this way, millions of sperms are released into the vagina at one time. The sperms are highly active and mobile. The sperms move up through cervix into the uterus. From uterus, the sperms pass into the oviducts. <br />
		One of the oviducts contains an ovum (or egg cell) released by the ovary during <span class="highlight01">ovulation</span>. Only one sperm fuses with the ovum in the oviduct to form a zygote. This is called fertilisation. Thus, the fertilisation of the ovum (or egg) takes place in the oviduct.</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image">

	 </div>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Development of Embryo</span>
		<br />
		When the ovum is fertilised in the oviduct, then a zygote is formed. The zygote divides rapidly by mitosis as it moves down slowly in the oviduct and forms a hollow ball of hundreds of cells.This hollow ball of cells, now called an embryo, sinks into the soft and thick lining of the uterus and gets embedded in it . The embedding of embryo in the thick lining of the uterus is called <span class="highlight01">implantation.</span>
	</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="104590004_image-37.png" alt="image37" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>After implantation, a disc-like special tissue develops between the uterus wall (called uterine wall) and the embryo, which is called <span class="highlight01">placenta.</span> It is through the placenta that all the requirements of the developing foetus like nutrition, respiration, and excretion, etc., are met from the mother's body. In other words, the exchange of nutrients, oxygen and waste products between the embryo and the mother takes place through the placenta.</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="104590004_image-38.png" alt="image38" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>The time period from the fertilisation up to the birth of the baby is called <span class="highlight01">gestation.</span> The average gestation period in humans is about nine months.During the gestation period, the foetus grows to become a baby. Birth begins when the strong muscles in the walls of the uterus start to contract rhythmically.The rhythmic contraction of uterus muscles gradually pushes the baby out of the mother's body through vagina. This is how a baby is born . All of us were born from our mother in this way.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Differences Between Zygote, Embryo and Foetus</span>
		<br />
		A zygote is formed after fertilisation. A zygote develops and becomes an embryo. And finally, an embryo develops and becomes a foetus. The main differences between zygote, embryo and foetus are given below:</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Sexual Cycle in Females:</h3>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Menstruation</span>
		<br />
		We will now describe the sexual cycle in human females. Please note that when a girl child is born, her ovaries already contain many thousands of immature ova which are contained in immature follicles.When a girl reaches the age of puberty, then one follicle develops at a time to form a mature ovum. <br />
		On maturing, the follicle bursts and the ovum shoots out of the ovary. This is called ovulation. Thus, the release of an ovum (or egg) from an ovary is called ovulation. In a normal, healthy woman, ovulation takes place on the 14th day of the beginning of menstrual cycle of 28 days. This means that ovulation takes place in the middle of the menstrual cycle. In human females, the ovaries start releasing ovum or egg once every 28 days from the age of puberty. That is, in girls ovulation starts when they attain puberty. Please note that ovulation does not take place every day after puberty.It takes place after a period of every 28 days. Before every ovulation, the inner lining of the uterus becomes thick and soft with lot of blood capillaries in it . These changes in the uterus are necessary because in case the ovum. released by the ovary gets fertilised by the sperm, then the uterus has to keep this fertilised ovum for further development and supply it with food and oxygen, etc., so that it may grow into a baby in due course of time.</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="104590004_image-40.png" alt="image40" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>If, however, a sperm is not available at the time of ovulation, then fertilisation of ovum does not take place. Since the ovum is not fertilised, so the thick and soft uterus lining having lot of blood capillaries in it is not required. Thus, the unfertilised ovum dies within a day and the uterus lining also breaks down. Since the thick and soft uterus lining contains a lot of blood vessels, so the breaking of the uterus lining produces blood alongwith other tissues. This blood and other tissues come out of the vagina in the form of 'bleeding'. We can now say that the breakdown and removal of the inner, thick and soft lining of the uterus along with its blood vessels in the form of vaginal bleeding is called menstrual flow or menstruation. Menstruation occurs if an ovum released by the ovary of a woman does not get fertilised due to non-availability of sperm at the time of ovulation. Since the process of menstruation in a woman occurs again and again after a fixed period of 28 days (to 30 days), so it is also known as menstrual cycle. <br /> Menstruation occurs every 28 days because ovulation occurs every 25 days. In everyday language, menstruation is called 'periods'. We will now describe the menstruation point-wise which can be reproduced in the examination. The sexual cycle in females is called menstruation or menstrual cycle. This is described below :</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>When a girl reaches puberty at the age of about 10 to 12 years, the sex hormones released into he: blood cause some of the ova in her ovaries to become mature.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Usually one mature ovum is released from the ovary into the oviduct once every 28 days. This is called ovulation.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Before ovulation, the inner lining of uterus becomes thick and spongy, and full of tiny blood vessels , and prepares it self to receive the fertilised ovum or egg. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If the ovum does not get fertilised then the thick and soft inner lining of uterus is no longer needed and hence it breaks. So, the thick and soft  along with the blood vessels and the dead ovum comes out of the vagina in the form of a bleeding called menstruation.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Menstruation usually occurs 14 days after ovulation and usually lasts for about 3 to 5 days.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>After menstruation is over, the inner lining of the uterus starts building up again so that it may become ready to receive the next ovum in case it gets fertilised.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If the ovum does not get fertilised even now, then menstruation takes place again. This cycle of menstruation is repeated again and again in women after every 28 days . The menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones. <br />
					Menstruation stops temporarily when the ovum gets fertilised and the woman gets pregnant. <br />
					This is because in this case the thick and soft lining of the uterus containing lot of blood vessels is needed for the growth and development of the fertilised ovum to form a baby. Menstruation restarts after the birth of the baby.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Menarche and Menopause</span>
		<br />
		The first menstruation begins at puberty (when the girl or woman is around 10 to 12 years of age). The first occurrence of menstruation at puberty is called menarche. Menarche is the beginning of the reproductive life of a girl. <br />
		In other words, menarche is the time from which a girl becomes capable of having a baby.Menstruation stops permanently when a woman reaches the age of about 45 to 50 years. With the permanent stoppage of menstruation, a woman loses her ability to bear children. She becomes infertile. The	permanent stoppage of menstruation in a woman is called menopause. Menopause occurs in women at the age of about 45 to 50 years.A woman stops ovulating at menopause and can no longer become pregnant. Menopause is the end of the reproductive life of a woman. We can now say that the reproductive life of a woman starts at menarche and ends at menopause.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Birth Control</h3>
	<p>The population of our country is increasing rapidly day by day . Though our country has sufficient food resources but still many people do not get sufficient food for their large families due to poverty. So, every year it is becoming very difficult for our Government to provide sufficient food, adequate clothing, good housing and proper education to every citizen of the country. <br />
		It is, therefore, very important for the couples (husbands and wives) who are in the reproductive stage of their lives to control the size of their families by having fewer children by practising family planning through birth control measures. <br />
		Family planning enables a couple to decide on the number of children it wants to have and when to have them. If a couple has less number of children, it can provide good food, good clothes, and good education to each child.This will make the parents as well as the children happy. So, a small family is a happy family.It should be noted that having fewer children also keeps the mother in good health. <br />
		We should remember that to keep the size of our family small by having less number of children is in our own interest as well as in the interest of our Nation.<br />
		Family planning can be done by practising birth control measures.  Birth control can be done by preventing pregnancy in females. And pregnancy can be prevented by adopting a method or procedure by which sperms produced during copulation between man and his wife can be prevented from meeting the ovum and fertilising it. It is possible to prevent fertilisation because the ovum is available for fertilisation only for a short period. Since frequent pregnancies have a very bad effect on the mother's health, and also add to our already exploding population, so a number of techniques or methods have been developed to prevent pregnancies in women. We can call them birth control measures, family Planning measures or population control measures. These are discussed below.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="08">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Birth Control Methods</h3>
	<p>The prevention of pregnancy in women (by preventing fertilisation) is called contraception.<br />
		And any device or chemical (drug) which prevents pregnancy in woman is called contraceptive. <br />
		All the birth control methods can be broadly divided into three categories: </p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Barrier methods</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Chemical methods</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Surgical methods</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>We will now discuss all these methods of contraception in women briefly.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Barrier Methods</h4>
		<p>In the barrier methods of preventing pregnancy, the physical devices such as condoms and diaphragm (or cap) are used.<br />
			Condoms are used by males. Condom is called 'nirodh' in Hindi. Diaphragm is used by females. Condom as well as diaphragm prevent the sperms from meeting the ovum (or egg) by acting as a barrier between them. An important benefit in the use of condom is that it protects a person from the sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhoea, syphilis is and AIDS. No other method of contracepticr provides protection against sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Chemical Methods</h4>
		<p>In the chemical methods of preventing pregnancy, the females use two types of pills: oral pills and vaginal pills, which are made of specific drugs. The oral pills contain hormones which stop the ovaries from releasing ovum into the oviduct.<br />
			Oral pills are also called Oral Contraceptives.This is a very effective method of preventing pregnancy so long as the pills are taken at the right time. Some women, however, do experience unpleasant side effects on taking oral pills because they change the hormonal balance in the body. So, it is important that the women on pills have regular check-ups with their doctor. The vaginal pills contain the chemicals called spermicides which kill the sperms.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Intra-Uterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD)</h4>
		<p>The use of intrauterine contraceptive device called Copper-T is also very effective in preventing pregnancy. A Copper-T is placed inside the uterus by a doctor or a trained nurse. The IUCD or Copper-T prevents the implantation of fertilised egg in the uterus. If a woman uses a Copper-T as a method of contraception for avoiding unwanted pregnancies, then Copper-T cannot protect her from acquiring sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Surgical Methods</h4>
		<p>Surgical methods of birth control are available for males as well as females. In males, a small portion of the sperm duct is removed by surgical operation and both the cut ends are ligated properly. This prevents the sperms from coming out. The surgical procedure carried out in males is called <span class="highlight01">Vasectomy'.</span> In females, a small portion of the oviducts is removed by surgical operation and the cut ends are ligated.This prevents the ovum from entering into the oviducts. The surgical procedure carried out in females is called <span class="highlight01">tubectomy.</span>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Female Foeticide </h3> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Stop Female Foeticide!</h4>
		<p>Surgical operations can also be used for the termination of pregnancies in women particularly after eight weeks of conception. Such surgical termination of pregnancy is allowed by law only in certain circumstances where the doctors decide that continuance of pregnancy can affect the health of mother or of unborn child gravely. Some people, however, misuse the technique of surgical termination of pregnancy for ulterior motive to get rid of female foetus. <br />
			n order to have a male child , some misguided people in our country get the sex of their unborn child determined by ultrasound technique , and if it is a female foetus, they get it removed by surgeryThis killing of the unborn girl child is called female foeticide. Female foeticide is reducing the number of girls drastically in some societies of our country.For a healthy society, the male-female sex ratio must be maintained at almost the same level.Due to reckless female foeticide, the male-female child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in some sections of our society. <br />
			This must be stopped immediately. Female foeticide is a matter of shame for the couples who go for it and also for the doctors who perform such surgical abortions for earning some quick money. Let us not forget that our mother is a female, our sister is a female, and our wife is also a female.Then why not have a female as our daughter? Remember, daughters are no less than sons.Our Government has already enacted laws to ban prenatal determination of sex of foetuses. These laws must be enforced strictly to save our society from the grave dangers of female foeticide in the long run.</p>

	 </div>
	<p>The diseases which are spread by sexual contact with an infected person are called sexually transmitted diseases (or STD). Thus, a healthy person can get STD by making sexual contact with an infected person. Some of the common sexually transmitted diseases are: </p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Gonorrhoea</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Syphilis</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>Gonorrhoea and syphilis are caused by bacteria. The bacteria which cause these diseases spread through sexual contact with an infected person. The most common symptoms of the these sexually transmitted diseases are burning sensation at urination, passing of urethral discharge (containing pus) and sores in the genitals. Gonorrhoea and syphilis are curable diseases. AIDS disease is caused by a virus called HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).<br />
		AIDS damages the body's immune system so that the body becomes weak and cannot protect itself against infection. So, AIDS is a very dangerous disease which leads to death. No definite cure has been found for the AIDS disease so far.</p>
