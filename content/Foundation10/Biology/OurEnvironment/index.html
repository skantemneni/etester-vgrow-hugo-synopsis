			<li>
				<p>Water in India is of two kinds. Salt water and fresh water. Fresh water is obtained from rain water, surface water and ground water.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The main sources of water are rain and snow which form a part of the hydrological cycle. </p>

								<span class="highlight01">Surface water: </span>India is blessed with a number of rivers, lakes, streams and ponds. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01">Ground water:</span> Aquifers are under ground reserves of fresh water. In the water table, water that percolates into the ground through porous rocks is ground water. These porous rocks are saturated with water to a certain level. The upper layer of water level is the water table. The ground water is important for plant growth, man also taps this water through tube wells and bore wells. Scanty rainfall and unnecessary felling of trees affect the ground water level.</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Desalination is more expensive than most other sources of fresh water.</p>
					</li>
					<li>

				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Rain water harvesting essentially means collecting rain water from the roof of building or courtyards and storing it underground for later use.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The main idea in harvesting rain water is to check the run-off water.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The rain water that falls on the roofs of buildings or in courtyards is collected through pipes and stored in underground tanks of the buildings fitted with motor for lifting water for use.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The process of rain water harvesting is not only simple but also economically beneficial</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>It helps in meeting the increased demand for water, particularly in urban areas and prevent flooding of living areas.</p>
