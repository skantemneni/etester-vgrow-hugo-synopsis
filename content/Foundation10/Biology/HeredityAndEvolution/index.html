					Here is an example of variations in human beings which involves our ears. The lowest part of our ear is called earlobe.

Thus, most people have free earlobes whereas some people have attached earlobes. So, the free earlobes and attached earlobes are the two variations found in human population.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Rules for the inheritance of Traits : Mendel's Contribution </h3>
	<p>Inheritance is the transmission ofecond gentically controlled characteristic(or traits) from one generation to,the next. We will now describe how Mendel studied the inheritance of characters or traits in various generations of pea plants cultivated by him.</p>
	<section class="sbuskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Monohybrid Inheritance and the Law of Segregation</h4>
		<p>In order to trace the inheritance of a single pair of contrasting characteristics among the pea plants (like tall stem and short stem), Mendel crossed (cross-bred) the pure-bred pea plants differing in these traits and noted their occurrence in the progeny of succeeding generations.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>	Mendel first crossed pure-bred tall pea plants with pure-bred dwarf pea plants and found that only tall pea plants were produced in the first generation or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_1 \) </span> generation . No dwarf pea plants were obtained in the first generation of progeny. <br />
						<span class="highlight01">Conclusion:</span> The first generation (or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_1 \) </span> cross) showed the traits of only one of the parent plants : tallness. The trait of other parent plant, dwarfness, did not show up in the progeny of first generation.</p>
					<div class="synopsis-image">

				<li>
					<p> He crossed the tall pea plants of the first generation(<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_1 \) </span> generation) and found that tall plants and dwarf plants were obtained in the second generation ( or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_2 \) </span> generation) in the ratio of 3 : 1.  <br />
						<span class="highlight01">Conclusion:</span>Mendel noted that the dwarf trait of the parent pea plant which had seemingly disappeared in the first generation progeny, reappeared in the second generation.</p>
					<div class="synopsis-image">

					 </div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Mendel said that the trait of dwarfness of one of parent	pea plant had not been lost, it was merely concealed or supressed in first generation to re-emerge in the second generation. Mendel called the repressed trait of <span class="highlight01">'dwarfness' as 'recessive trait'</span> and the expressed trait of <span class="highlight01">'tallness'</span> as the <span class="highlight01">'dominant trait'.</span> So, the traits aits may be dominant or recessive. </p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Other observations</span>
		</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>All the pea plants produced from the hybrid tall parents of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_1 \) </span> generation, were either tall or dwarf. There were no plants with intermediate height in-between the tall and dwarf plants. So, the traits are inherited independently. This is because if the traits of tallness or dwarfness had blended, then medium sized pea plants would have been produced.</p>
				</li> 
				<li>
					<p> The ratio of tall plants to dwarf plants in the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_2 \) </span> generation is 3 : 1. Since tallness is a dominant traits and dwarfness is a recessive trait, so we can also say that the contrasting progeny in the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_2 \) </span> generation occur in the ratio of 3 dominant to 1 recessive. The ratio 3 : 1 is know as the monohybrid ratio.</p>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Mendel's first law of inheritance: </h5>
		<p>The characteristics of an organism are determined by internal 'factors' which occur in pairs. only one of a pair of such factors can be present in a single gamete. </p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Explanation of Results of Monohybrid Inheritance</span>
		</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p> Each trait is determined by a pair of <span class="highlight01">factors.</span> This means that the pure-bred tall pea plant has two factors TT for the trait of tallness, and the pure-bred dwarf pea plant also has two factors tt for the trait of dwarfness.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The factors of inheritance of tallness <span class="highlight01">TT</span> separate into two gametes <span class="highlight01">T and
							T</span>, and the factors for inheritance of dwarfness tt separate into two other gametes t and t. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> The gametes of tall pea plant then cross with the gametes of the dwarf pea plant by the process of fertilisation to form zygotes which then produce various progeny in the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_1 \) </span> generation (or first generation) which consists of all tall plants. Thus, the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_1 \) </span> generation possesses one factor of inheritance from each parent plant which were carried in gametes. The parental cross is shown clearly in the following chart :</p>
					<div class="synopsis-image"> 
						<img src="104590005_image-4.png" alt="image4" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
					 </div>
					<p>In the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_1 \) </span> generation shown above, all the progeny plants have factors Tt in which T is the factor for tallness which is a dominant trait. Since all the plants in the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_1 \) </span> generation have the factors Tt, so all of them are tall. The small letter t represents recessive trait of dwarfness, which does not show up in first generation in the presence of dominant trait T. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> When two hybrid, tall pea plants (Tt) produced in the first generation (Fj) are now cross-bred with each other, then they will produce second generation (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_2 \) </span>) pea plants. This again happens by the separation of factors of inheritance of these tall plants into individual gametes, and then crossing of the gametes during fertilisation as shown below :</p>
					<div class="synopsis-image"> 
						<img src="104590005_image-5.png" alt="image5" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
					 </div>
					<p>We can see from the above chart that in the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_2 \) </span> generation, the pea plants produced have genotype or inheritance factors TT, Tt, Tt and tt. Now, the plants having genotype TT, Tt and Tt all contain the factor T for dominant trait 'tallness', so all the three plants(TT, Tt and Tt)  are tall.  the plant having the genotype tt has both factors t for the recessive trait 'dwarfness', so it is a dwarf plant. Please note that though a single copy of factor T is enough to make a plant tall but both copies of factor t (that Is tt) are necessary to make a plant dwarf (or short). <br />
						In the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_2 \) </span> generation, we get 1 plant having genotype TT, 2 plants having genotype Tt and 1 plant having genotype tt. So, the genotypic ratio in monohydrid cross will be : <br />
						TT : Tt : tt = 1 : 2 : 1 <br />
						Again, in the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_2 \) </span> generation, we get 3 tall plants and 1 dwarf plant, so the phenotypic ratio in monohybrid cross will be : <br />
						Tall plants : Dwarf plants = 3:1 <br />
						This result is the same as that obtained by Mendel through experiments.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Dihybrid Inheritance and the Law of Independent Assortment</h4>
		<p>Dihybrid inheritance involves the inheritance of two Dihybrid inheritance involves the inheritance of two pairs of contrasting characteristics at the same time. The two pairs of contrasting characteristics chosen by Mendel were shape and colour of seeds : round-yellow seedsand wrinkled-green seeds. In order to trace the inheritance of two pairs of contrasting traits, Mendel crossed pea plants having round yellow seeds with pea plants having wrinkled-green seeds and noted their occurrence in the succeeding generations of pea plants. Mendel made the following observations:</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Mendel first crossed pure-bred pea plants having round-yellow seeds with pure-bred pea plants having wrinkled-green seeds and found that only round-yellow seeds were produced in the first generation. No wrinkled-green seeds were obtained in the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_1 \) </span> generation. <br />
						<span class="highlight01">Conclusion:</span> Round shape and yellow colour of the seeds were dominant traits over the wrinkled shape and green colour of the seeds.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> When the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_1 \) </span> generation pea plants having round-yellow seeds were cross-bred by self pollination, then four types of seeds having different combinations of shape and colour were obtained in second generation or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_2 \) </span> generation. These were round-yellow, round-green, wrinkled-yellow and wrinkled-green seeds. Mendel collected a total of 556 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_2 \) </span> seeds and counted them shape wise and colour wise. He got the following result: <br />
						Round-yellow seeds	315 <br />
						Round-green seeds	108  <br />
						Wrinkled-yellow seeds 101 <br />
						Wrinkled-green seeds	32 <br />
						The phenotypic ratio of different type of seeds can be written as : <br />
						Round-yellow seeds : Round-green seeds : Wrinkled-yellow seeds : Wrinkled-green seeds = 315 : 108 : 101 : 32 <br />
						= 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 <br />
						Thus, the ratio of each phenotype (or appearance) of the seeds in the F2 generation is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. This is known as the dihybrid ratio.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Explanation of Results of Dihybrid Inheritance</span>
			<br />
			In the dihybrid cross, the parent plants having the phenotype round-yellow seeds have the factors of inheritance or gene combination RRYY (in which RR are the dominant genes for round shape whereas YY are the dominant genes for yellow colour). On the other hand, the parent plants having the phenotype wrinkled-green seeds have the factors of inheritance or gene combination rryy (in which rr are the recessive genes for wrinkled shape and yy are the recessive genes for green colour). Keeping these points in mind, we can now show the dihybrid cross by drawing a chart as we did in the case of a monohybrid cross. The chart showing the dihybrid cross between pea plants having round-yellow seeds and wrinkled-green seeds is given below.</p>

			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_2 \) </span> ration:   Round yellow = 9; Round green = 3 <br />
			Wrinkled yellow = 3; Wrinkled green = 1. <br />
			This result is the same as that obtained by Mendel through experiments. <br />
			An amazing thing about Mendel's work is that he worked out the underlying rules of inheritance before any knowledge of DNA, chromosomes or genes became available.Let us answer one question now.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">How are characteristics (or traits) transmitted to progeny </h5>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590005_image-8.png" alt="image8" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<div class="list1-ul default-spaced-indented list-bullet-style-image-square">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Genes work in pairs. There is a pair of genes for each characteristic of an organism. Each parent possesses a pair of genes for each characteristic on a pair of chromosomes. However, each parent passes only one of the two genes of the pair for each characteristic to its progeny through garmetes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The male gamete and female gamete carry one gene for each characteristic from the gene pairs of parents. When a male gamete fuses with a female gamete during fertilisation, they make a new cell called zygote with a full set of genes . This zygote grows and develops to form a new organism having characteristics from both the parents which it has inherited through genes. <br />
						The two genes responsible for a particular characteristic are always present on the corresponding positions of the pair of chromosomes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>For example, in the adjacent figure the two genes for the same characteristic (length of plant stem), are present on the corresponding positions of the pair of chromosomes. One gene of the pair is for 'tallness' and the other is for 'dwarfness'. Please note that though the progeny inherits two genes for each trait from its parents but the trait shown by the progeny depends on which inherited gene is dominant of the two.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">How do Genes Control the Characteristics (or Traits)</h5>
		<p>A gene is the section of DNA on a chromosome which codes for the formation of a protein controlling a specific characteristic(or trait) of the organism. Suppose a plant progeny has gene for the characteristic called 'tallness'. Now, the gene for tallness will give instructions to the plant cells to make a lot of plant growth hormones. And due to the formation of excess of plant growth hormones, the plant will grow too much and hence become tall. On the other hand, if the plant has the gene set for dwarfness, then less plant growth hormones will be produced due to which the plant will grow less, remain short and hence become a dwarf plant.</p>
		<p>Just like plants, the characteristics in animals (including human beings) are also transmitted from the parents through genes by the process of sexual reproduction.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">How Blood Groups are Inherited</h5>
		<p>A person has one of the four blood groups: A, B, AB or O. This blood group system is controlled by a gene which has three different forms denoted by the symbols <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I^A, I^B \ and \ 1^O  \) </span> The genes  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I^A, \ and \ I^B  \) </span> show no dominance over each other, that is, they are codominant. However, genes <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I^A, \ and \ I^B  \) </span> both are dominant over the gene <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I^O. \) </span> In other words, the blood gene <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1^O \) </span> is recessive in relation to genes <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I^A, \ and \ I^B.  \) </span>
			<br />
			Although there are three gene forms (called alleles) for blood, but any one person can have only two of them. So, the blood group of a person depends on which two forms of the genes he possesses.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p> If the genotype(gene combination) is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I^A I^A, \) </span>	then the blood group of the person is A. And if the genotype is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I^A 1^O, \) </span> even then the blood group is A(because  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1^O \) </span> is a recessive gene).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If the genotype is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I^B I^B, \) </span> then the blood group of the person is B. And if the genotype is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I^B 1^O, \) </span> even then the blood group is B (because P is a recessive gene).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> If the genotype is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I^A I^B, \) </span> then the blood group of the person is AB.</p>

			<img src="104590005_image-9.png" alt="image9" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>The process by which the sex of a person is determined is called sex determination. Genetics is involved in the determination of the sex of a person. This can be explained as follows. <br />
			The chromosomes which determine the sex of a person are called sex chromosomes. There are two types of sex chromosomes, one is called X chromosome and the other is called Y chromosome.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>A male has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome . This means that half the male gametes or half the sperms will have X chromosomes and the other half will have Y chromosomes </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> A female has two X chromosomes but no Y chromosomes. This means that all the female gametes called ova (or eggs) will have only X chromosomes.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>The sex of a child depends on what happens at fertilisation :</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>If a sperm carrying X chromosome fertilises an ovum (or egg) which carries X chromosome, then the child born will be a girl (or female). This is because the child will have XX combination of sex chromosomes. </p>
				</li>
				<div class="synopsis-image"> 
					<img src="104590005_image-10.png" alt="image10" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
				 </div>
				<li>
					<p> If a sperm carrying Y chromosome fertilises an ovum which carries X chromosome, then the child born will be a boy. This is because the child will have XY combination of sex chromosomes. Please note that it is the sperm which determines the sex of the child. This is because half of the sperms have X chromosomes and the other half have Y chromosomes. Thus, there is a 50 per cent chance of a boy and a 50 per cent chance of a girl being born to the parents. This is why the human population is roughly half males and half females.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Acquired and Inherited Traits</h3>
	<div class="list1-ul default-spaced-indented list-bullet-style-image-square">
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>A trait(or characteristic) of an organism which is 'not inherited' but develops in response to the environment is called an acquired trait.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Suppose the tail of a mouse gets cut. The 'cut tail' of this mouse is also an acquired trait which has been brought about by some agent in its environment.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A man may know how to swim or roller skate or speak French or may have a scar on the face from a cut he got in an accident. All these are acquired traits (or characteristics) which the man has picked up(or acquired) himself as he goes through life.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The man is not born with these traits and he cannot pass on these traits to his children. The acquired traits of organisms cannot be passed on to their future generations.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The changes in the non-reproductive body cells of an organism cannot be inherited by its offsprings. This will become clear from the following examples.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>When the weight of a beetle is reduced too much due to starvation, then though there is a change in the normal body cells of the beetle but no change takes place in the genes (or DNA) present in its <span class="highlight01">reproductive cells (or gametes). And since there is </span> no change in the genes (or DNA) of gametes, this acquired trait (of low weight) of beetle cannot be inherited by its offsprings. So, if some generations of beetles are low in body weight because of the availability of less food, then this is not an example of evolution because this change cannot be inherited over generations. Whenever these beetles will get sufficient food, they will become healthy again and the trait of 'low body weight' will disappear. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Let us discuss the other example now. If we breed some mice, all the progeny of mice will have tails, just like their parents. Now, if we cut the tails of these first generation mice surgically and breed them, we will get new mice, all with full tails. It has been observed that even after cutting the tails of mice for a number of generations, a tail-less mouse is never born. Actually, the cut tail of mice is an acquired trait which is never passed on to their progeny. </p>
				<div class="synopsis-image"> 
					<img src="104590005_image-11.png" alt="image11" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
				 </div>
				<p>This is because cutting the tails of mice does not change the genes of their reproductive cells (or gametes). And since the acquired trait of 'cut tails' does not bring about a change in the genes of mice, this trait cannot be passed on to their next generations. From this discussion we conclude that the experiences of an individual during its life time (called acquired traits) cannot be passed on to its progeny, and hence cannot lead to evolution (because they are not caused by the change in genes).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A trait (or characteristic) of an organism which is caused by a change in its genes (or DNA) is called an inherited trait. Inherited traits can be passed on to the progeny of the organism because they have produced changes in the genes (or DNA) of the organism. Suppose there during is a population of red beetles in the green bushes. Again suppose that a colour variation arises reproduction in so that there is one beetle which is green in colour (instead of red). This change of green colour the beetle has been brought about by a change in the genes (or DNA) of the reproductive cells. The green colour of this beetle is an inherited trait which can be passed on to the next generations.The change from red beetle to green beetle can be considered to be an example of evolution, because it helps in its survival by mixing with green bushes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Inherited traits actually mean the characteristics which We receive from our parents. This point will become more clear from the following example. Suppose a father has red curly hair, brown eyes, a snub nose and a cleft chin. Again suppose that the mother has straight black hair, blue eyes, a long thin nose and a pointed chin.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The children in the family inherit some characteristics from each of their parents. For example two children have red hair like father but one of them has straight red hair while the other one has curly red hair. The two children have black hair like the mother. Again, two children have brown eyes like father but the other two have blue eyes like the mother. And finally, two children have snub nose and cleft chin like father whereas the other two have a long thin nose and a pointed chin.</p>

		<span class="highlight01">Evolution</span> is the sequence of gradual changes which take place in the primitive organisms over millions of years in which new species are produced. Since the evolution is of the living organisms, so it is also called <span class="highlight01">'organic evolution'.</span> It is through the constant process of evolution taking place in the organisms since origin of life that such an enormous variety of plants and animals have come to exist on this earth at present. All the plants and animals (or organisms) which we see today around us have evolved from some or the other ancestors that lived on this earth long, long ago.</p>

	<p>The development of 'pterosaur' (an ancient flying reptile) from a big lizard is an example of evolution. The process of evolution will become clear from the following example of 'pterosaur'. Pterosaur is an anicient flying reptile which lived on the earth about 150 million years ago. The development of pterosaur is an example of evolution. It began life as a big lizard which could just crawl on land Over millions of years, small folds of skin developed between its feet which enabled it to glide from tree to tree. <br />
		Over many, many generations, spread over millions of years, the folds of skin, and the bones and muscles supporting them grew to form wings which could make it fly. In this way, an animal which crawled on ground evolved into a flying animal. This evolution led to the formation of a new species (of a flying reptile). </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Evidences for Evolution</h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Homologous Organs Provide Evidence for Evolution</h5>
		<p>There are many organs in different groups of animals or plants which all seem to be built from the same basic design but are used for many different purposes. These are called <span class="highlight01">homologous organs.</span> For example, the forelimbs of a man, a lizard (reptile), a frog(amphibian), a bird and a bat (mammal) seem to be built from the same basic design of bones, but they perform different functions. The forelimbs of a human (man), a lizard, a frog, a bird and a bat have the same basic design of bones.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590005_image-13.png" alt="image13" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>They are homologous organs, forelimbs of a human (man) are used for grasping; the forelimbs of a lizard are used for running; the forelimbs of a frog are used to prop up the front end of its body when at rest, and also act as shock absorbers when the frog lands back on the ground after a leap; whereas the forelimbs of a bird and a bat are modified for flying. Since the forelimbs of a human, a lizard, a frog, a bird and a bat have similar structures (or design) but perform different functions, they are the homologous organs <br />
			The presence of homologous forelimbs in humans (man), a lizard, a frog, a bird and a bat indicate that all these forelimbs have evolved from a common ancestral animal which had a 'basic design' limb. In other words, it tells us that a human, a lizard, a frog, a bird and a man, all have evolved from a common ancestor. Thus, the presence of homologous organs in different animals provides evidence for evolution by telling us that they are derived from the same ancestor who had the 'basic design' of the organ on which all the homologous organs are based. Please note that the wings of a butterfly (which is an insect) and the wings of a bat cannot be considered to be homologous organs because they have different basic designs (though they are used for the same purpose of flying).</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Analogous Organs Provide Evidence for Evolution</h5>
		<p>organs which have different basic structure (or different basic design) but have similar appearance and perform similar functions are called analogous organs. The analogous organs provide the evidence for evolution. This point will become clear from the following discussion.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104590005_image-14.png" alt="image14" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>There are many organs in different groups of animals which seem to be built from different basic structure but appear to be similar in shape and perform similar functions. These are called analogous organs. For example, the wings of an insect and a bird have different structures (the insects have a fold of membranes as wings which are associated with a few muscles whereas a skeleton, flesh and feathers support bird's wings) but they perform the same function of flying . Since the wings of insects and birds have different structures (or different designs) but perform similar functions, they are analogous organs. Now, since the analogous organs have different basic design, so they do not indicate a common ancestor for the organism. The analogous organs provide evidence for the evolution in another way. The presence of analogous organs indicates that even the organisms having organs with different structures can adapt to perform similar functions for their survival under hostile environmental conditions. Thus, the presence of analogous organs in different animals provide evidence for evolution by telling us that though they are not derived from common ancestors, they can still evolve to perform similar functions to survive, flourish and keep on evolving in the prevailing environment. The analogous organs actually provide a mechanism for evolution.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Fossils Provide Evidence for Evolution</h5>
		<p>The remains(or impressions) of dead animals or plants that lived in the remote past are known as fossils. The fossils provide evidence for evolution. For example, a fossil bird called Archaeopteryx looks like a bird but it has many other features which are found in reptiles. This is because Archaeopteryx has feathered wings like those of birds but teeth and tail like those of reptiles. Archaeopteryx is, therefore, a connecting link between the reptiles and birds, and hence suggests that the birds have evolved from the reptiles. Thus, fossils provide the evidence that the present animals (and plants) have originated from the previously existing ones through the process of continuous evolution.<br />We will now describe how fossils are formed. Usually, when organisms (plants or animals) die, their bodies will decompose by the action of micro-organisms in the presence of oxygen, moisture, etc. Sometimes, however, the conditions in the environment are such(like absence of oxygen or moisture, etc), which do not let the body of the organism to decompose completely. It is such body (or body part) of an organism which we get as fossil on digging the earth. <br />
			In many cases the soft parts of the organisms get decomposed and what we get as a fossil is a skeleton of hard parts (like bones, etc). Even the soft parts of the plants and animals (which usually decompose quickly) are sometimes preserved as fossils in the form of their impressions inside the rocks. For example, if a dead leaf gets caught in mud, it will not decompose quickly. The mud around the leaf will set around it as a mould, gradually harden to form a rock and retain the impression of the whole leaf. This forms a leaf fossil which can be dug out from the earth a long time later . The fossil of a dead insect caught in mud is also formed in a similar way to leaf fossil. All such preserved impressions of the body parts of the once living organisms are also called fossils.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Fossils are</span> obtained by <span class="highlight01">digging into the earth. </span> The age of fossils can be estimated in two ways: by the relative method, and by the carbon dating method. The relative method works like this: When we dig into the earth, we find fossils at different depths. The fossils which we find in layers closer to the surface of the earth are more recent; the fossils which are found in deeper layers are older; whereas the fossils found in the deepest layers of earth are the oldest ones. Fossils which we find today were once living objects. All the living objects contain some carbon-14 atoms which are radioactive. When a living object dies and forms fossil, its carbon-14 radioactivity goes on decreasing gradually. In the carbon dating method, the age of fossils is found by comparing the carbon-14 radioactivity left in fossils with the carbon-14 radioactivity present in living objects today.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">There are various kinds of fossils. </span> Some of the important fossils which have been studied are those of ammonite, <span class="highlight01">trilobite </span> and dinosaur. Ammonites were the invertebrate animals (molluscs) with a flat, coiled, spiral shell which lived in the sea. The estimation of the age of ammonite fossils have told us that they are about 180 million years old. This means that ammonites lived in the sea about 180 million years ago. Another invertebrate animal fossil which has been studied is that of trilobite. Trilobites were marine arthropods which were common between 400 to 600 million years ago. Dinosaurs are extinct carnivorous or herbivorous reptiles The estimation of the age of dinosaur fossils have told us that they first appeared on earth about 250 million years ago and became extinct about 65 million years ago. It is clear from the above discussion that we can even study about those species which are extinct (no longer exist), by studying their fossils which are found during the digging of earth.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Darwin's Theory of Evolution</h3>
	<p>Charles Robert Darwin gave the theory of evolution in his famous book 'The Origin of Species'. The theory of evolution proposed by Darwin is known as 'The Theory of Natural Selection'. This theory is called the theory of natural selection because it suggests that the best adapted organisms are selected by nature to pass on their characteristics(or traits) to the next generation. Darwin's theory of evolution applies to plants as well as animals.</p> 
	<section class="sbuskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Darwin's theory of evolution can be described as follows :</h4>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>With in any population, there is natural variation. Some individuals have more favourable variations than others. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Even though all species produce a large number of off springs, populations remain fairly constant naturally. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>This is due to the struggle between members of the same species and different species for food, space and mate. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The struggle for survival within populations eliminates the unfit individuals. The fit individuals possessing favourable variations survive and reproduce. This is called natural selection (or survival of the fittest).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The individuals having favourable variations pass on these variations to their progeny from generation to generation. </p>
				</li>
				<li>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Understanding Darwin's Theory</h4>
		<p>We will now understand Darwin's theory of evolution by 'natural selection' by taking an example. No two animals are ever exactly alike. So some changes always appear when animals produce their progeny by sexual reproduction. For example, one of the progeny may be tall (having long legs) than the other progeny. Thus, there may be a variation of height in the progeny. Now, the advantage of long legs to the progeny is that when no food (grass, etc.) is available on the ground, then this progeny having long legs can reach the leaves on tall trees, eat them as food and survive. On the other hand, the progeny which have short height (due to short legs) cannot reach the leaves on tall trees, they will not get any food, they will starve and hence die . Thus, nature has selected the animal with long legs to survive (because it is the fittest animal under these circumstances). Now, since long legs help in survival, the long-legged animals will live long enough to produce their off springs. The offspring will inherit long legs. So, all the future generations will have long-legged animals. In this way, the animals having short legs have evolved into animals having long legs due to variation. This is an example of evolution.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image">

		 </div>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Natural selection is the process of evolution of a species were by characteristics which help individual organisms to survive and reproduce are passed on to their offspring, and those characteristics which do not help are not passed on.</span>
			<br />
			Though Darwin's theory was widely accepted, but it was criticised on the ground that it could not explain 'how the variations arise'. With the progress in genetics, the source of variations was explained to be the 'genes' . Genes vary in natural population. Genetic variation is the raw material of evolution. So, the Darwin's theory was modified accordingly. These days, the most accepted theory of evolution is the Synthetic Theory of Evolution in which the origin of species is based on the interaction of 'genetic variation' and 'natural selection'. <br />
			Sometimes, a species may completely die out. It may become extinct. Dodo was a large flightless bird which has become extinct. Once a species is extinct,its genes are lost for ever. It cannot re-emerge at all. The small numbers of surviving tigers are a cause of worry from the point of view of genetics because if they all die out and become extinct, their genes will be lost for ever. Our coming generations will not be able to sec tigers at all. We should, therefore, make all out efforts to protect tigers to prevent them from extinction.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Speciation</h3>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">A species is a population of organisms consisting of similar individuals which can breed together and produce fertile offspring. <br />
			The process by which new species develop from the existing species is known as speciation. In simple words, the formation of new species is called speciation. </span>

	<p>Important factors which could lead speciation	are as follows:</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Evolution of Eyes</h4>
		<p>First of all the rudimentary eye (basic eye) like that of a flatworm (Planaria) was formed. The eyes of flatworm are very simple that are actually just 'eye-spots' which can detect light. Even these rudimentary eyes provide a survival advantage to flatworm. Starting from this basic design, more and more complex eyes were then evolved in various organisms. Most of the animals have eyes. For example, the insects, octopus and invertebrates, all have eyes. The structure of eyes in each of these organisms is, however, different which suggests their separate evolutionary origins. The evolution of simple eyes called rudimentary eyes, eye is an example of evolution by stages.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Evolution of Feathers</h4>
		<p>Sometimes an evolutionary change produced in an organism for one purpose later on becomes more useful for an entirely different function. For example,birds evolved feathers as a means of providing insulation to their bodies in cold weather but later on these feathers became more useful for the purpose of flying. Even some dinosaurs had feathers though they could not fly by using these feathers. Birds, however, adapted feathers for flying. The presence of feathers on birds tells us that the birds are very closely related to reptiles because dinosaurs (which had feathers) were reptiles</p>

	<section class="sbuskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Evolution by Artificial Selection</h4>
		<p>In the evidence for evolution we have studied that very dissimilar looking structures can evolve from a common ancestral body design. But that was all guesswork about what happened in history long time ago. We will now give an example from the present	which will show that different looking organisms can in fact be created from the same basic design of the ancestor. <br />
			The wild cabbage plant is a good example to prove that entirely different looking organisms can evolve from the same organism by the process of evolution. The only difference is that here we are using artificial selection for evolution in place of natural selection. This will become clear from the following discussion.</p>
		<p>The farmers have been cultivating wild cabbage as a food plant for over two thousand years and have produced (or evolved) entirely different looking vegetables like cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kohlrabi and kale from it by artificial selection.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Some farmers wanted to have very short distances between the leaves of wild cabbage and produced the common variety of 'cabbage'. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>When farmers opted for the arrested flower development of wild cabbage plant, it led to the production of another variety of cabbage called 'broccoli'.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Some farmers went in for sterile flowers of wild cabbage and developed another variety of cabbage called 'cauliflower'. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>When farmers opted for the swollen parts of wild cabbage, it led to the evolution of a yet another variety of cabbage called 'kohlrabi'. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>And finally, the farmers wanted to grow large leaves of wild cabbage and ended up producing a leafy vegetable called 'kale' which is also a variety of wild cabbage.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Now, wild cabbage is the ancestor and cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kohlrabi and kale are all its varieties which have been obtained by evolution 'induced artificially' by the farmers. The ordinary cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kohlrabi and kale look so different from their ancestor wild cabbage that if people had not seen it being done with their own eyes, they would never have believed that vegetables having such different structures can be evolved from the same ancestral vegetable plant.</p>

	<section class="sbuskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Evolution Should Not be Equated With Progress</h4>
		<p>There is no real progress in the concept of evolution. Evolution is just the production of diversity of life forms and shaping of this diversity by the environmental selection. The only progress in evolution appears to be that more and more complex body designs of organisms have emerged over the ages. This will become clear from the following examples.<br />
			When a new species is formed, it is not necessary that the old species will disappear (or get eliminated) from earth. It will all depend on the environment. Also it is not as if the newly formed species are in any way better than the older ones. It is simply that genetic drill and natural selection processes have combined to form a population having different body design which cannot interbreed with the older population. It is a common belief that chimpanzees are the ancestors of human beings. It is, however, not true that human beings have evolved from chimpanzees. Actually, both chimpanzees and human beings had a common ancestor long time ago. The two offsprings of that ancestor evolved in their own separate ways to form the modern day chimpanzees and human beings. <br />
			Again, it is not as if the body designs of older organisms were inefficient. This is because many of the older and simpler forms of organisms still survive on earth. For example, one of the simplest and primitive life forms called 'bacteria' still inhabit some of the most inhospitable (or unfavourable) habitats such as hot springs, deep-sea thermal vents and the ice in Antarctica. Most other organisms cannot survive in such harsh environments.</p>
	</section>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="09">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Human Evolution</h3>
	<p>Human evolution has been studied by using the various tools of tracing evolutionary relationships like excavating (digging earth), carbon-dating, studying fossils and determining DNA sequences. There is so much diversity of human body and features on the earth that for a long time people used to talk about different 'races' of human beings. The human races were even identified on the basis of their skin colour and named as white, black, yellow or brown. It is now known that the so called human races have not evolved differently. In fact, there is no biological basis for dividing human beings into different 'races'. All human beings (whether, white, black, yellow or brown) are a single species (called Homo sapiens). It has now been established by research that the earliest members of the human species {Homo sapiens} came from Africa. So, irrespective of where we have lived for the past few thousand years, we all come from Africa. In other words, our genetic footprints tell us that we have African roots. About hundred thousand years ago, some of our ancestors left Africa while others stayed back. Those who left Africa slowly spread across the whole earth. <br />
		Mendel's experiments tell us the mode of inheritance of traits from one generation to the next and Darwin's theory of evolution tells us how organisms develop from simple to more complex forms. But neither tells us anything about how life originated on earth (or began on earth). We will now discuss the origin of life on earth briefly.</p> 
	<section class="sbuskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Origin of Life on Earth</h4>
		<p>A British scientist J.B.S. Haldane suggested in 1929 that life must have developed from the simple inorganic molecules (such as methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, etc.) which were present on the earth soon after it was formed. He said that the conditions on earth at that time (including frequent lightning) could have converted simple inorganic molecules into complex organic molecules which were necessary for life. These complex organic molecules must have joined together to form first primitive living organisms. Haldane also suggested from theoretical considerations that life (or living organisms) originated in the sea water. <br />
			The theory of origin of life on earth proposed by Haldane was confirmed by experiments conducted by Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey in 1953. They assembled an apparatus to create an early earth atmosphere which was supposed to of gases like methane, ammonia and hydrogen sulphide,  etc., (but no oxygen), over water. This was maintained at a temperature just below <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( 100^{\circ} C  \) </span> and electric sparks were then passed through the mixture of gases (to simulate lightning) for about one week. At the end of one week, it was found that about 15 per cent of carbon (from methane) had been converted into simple compounds of carbon including 'amino acids' which make up protein molecules found in living organisms. This experiment provides the evidence that the life originated from inanimate matter (or lifeless matter) like inorganic molecules.</p>
