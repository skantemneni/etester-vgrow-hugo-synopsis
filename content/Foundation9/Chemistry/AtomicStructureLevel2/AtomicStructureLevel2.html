	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Matter is anything which has mass and occupies space. The Indian and the Greek philosophers believed that matter was made up of very small indivisible particles. These particles were named as 'atoms' (meaning indivisible) by Greek and paramanu by Indian philosophers, but improvement about the concept of atom was there till the beginning of the 19th century. <br />
		Atoms of all the elements (except hydrogen) are made up of the three sub - atomic particles; electrons, protons and neutrons. The discovery and study of these fundamental particles led to the complete study of internal structure of atom, leading to study of various atomic models of atom.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Production of cathode rays- Discovery of Electron</h3>
	<p>The existence of electrons in an atom was shown by J.J. Thomson in 1897 by passing electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure in a discharge tube. A common discharge tube is a long glass tube having two metal plates sealed at its two ends. These metal plates are known as electrodes. The electrode which is connected to the positive terminal of the battery is known as anode (positive electrode), and the electrode which is connected to the negative terminal of the battery is called cathode (negative electrode). Discharge tube has a side tube through which air (or other gases) can be pumped out by using a vacuum pump, so that experiments can be performed at low pressures.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Production of anode rays - Discovery of Protons</h3>
	<p>The formation of cathode rays has shown that all the atoms contain negatively charged particles called electrons. Now, an atom is electrically neutral, so it must contain some positively charged particles to balance the negative charge of electrons. By experiments it has been found that all the atoms contain positively charged particles called protons. The existence of the protons in the atoms was shown by Goldstein. In the production of positive rays a discharge tube having perforated cathode is used. A perforated cathode is a cathode having holes in it. These perforations or holes allow the positive rays to pass through them. It is known that some rays are formed at the anode and when these rays strike the walls of the discharge tube, they produce a faint red light. Since these rays are formed at the anode (positive electrode), they are known as anode rays or positive rays.</p>

					<p>Anode rays are positively charged. This is shown by the fact that anode rays are deflected towards the negative plate of an electric field.</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The mass of anode ray particle is almost equal to the mass of the atom from which it is formed. The mass and charge of the positive ray particles depend upon which gas is taken in the discharge tube. Different gases give different types of positive rays which contain particles having different masses and different charges. In other words, the charge to mass ratio ( e/m ratio) is not constant for positive ray particles obtained from different gases, it changes with the nature of gas taken in discharge tube. The charge to mass ratio (e/m) for the positive particles is maximum for hydrogen gas ( <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  9.58 \times 10^4   \) </span> coulombs per gram).</p>

For example, a carbon atom contains 6 protons and 6 electrons. Now, the mass of electrons is so small that it can be ignored. So, the atomic mass of carbon should be only 6, which is the mass of 6 protons. This, however, is wrong because the actual atomic mass of carbon is 12.

		<p> An element has 2 electrons in the M shell. What is the atomic number of that element? </p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			There are 2 electrons in the M shell. It means that the K shell and L shell, which preceeds the M shell, are completely filled. The K shell can contain a maximum of 2 electrons and the L shell a maximum of 8 electrons. Thus, the electronic configuration of the element is <br />
			K - L  - M  <br />
			2 - 8 -  2 <br />
			Hence, the total number of electrons in the atom is equal to 2 + 8 + 2 = 12<br />
			Atomic number = number of protons = No. of electrons = 12.</p>

			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Anode rays deflect less than cathode rays. Anode rays are ions and the smallest massive  anode rays are protons. Protons are 1837 heavier than cathode rays. Since the mass of anode rays is more than that of cathode rays, cathode rays undergo deflection more.</p>

		<p>It is possible to write the electronic configuration of an atom if we know its atomic number. Explain.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			In order to write the electronic configuration of an atom, we should know the number of electrons present in it. The atomic number of a neutral atom (or element) is equal to the number of electrons present in one atom of the element since the atomic number tells us the number of electrons present in the atom and becomes possible to write its electronic configuration. In case of an ion if magnitude of charge is known, based on its atomic number its electronic configuration can be written.</p>
