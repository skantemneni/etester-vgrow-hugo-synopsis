	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>The air we breathe in, the water and milk we drink are not pure substances but these are called as mixtures. A mixture is formed when two or more chemically non reacting substances are mixed. A mixture may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. A heterogeneous mixture has distinctive phases. The observed properties are just the sum of the properties of their individual phases. A homogeneous mixture consists of a single phase which has properties that may differ drastically from those of their individual components. <br />
		Homogeneous mixtures are termed as solutions.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="02">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Solutions</h3>
	<p>A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances, whose comPosition can be varied within certain limits depending on the total components present in its solution. They are classified as binary sloution (two components), ternary solution (three components), quaternary solution (four components). The components of a binary solution are termed as solute and the solvent. Solute is a component which is present in relatively in excess.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Types of Solution</h4>
		<p>All the three states of matter mainly solids, liquids and gases may be have either as a solvent or as a solute. Depending on the solute or solvent mainely there may be the following types of binary solution.</p>

				<p>If we go on adding salt to the unsaturated solution, a stage comes where the solution cannot dissolve any more salt. Such solution which cannot dissolve any more solute is called a <span class="highlight01"> saturated solution </span>. <br />

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Concentration</h3>
	<p>The amount of solute present in a given amountof solution is known as concentration. It can be described quantitatively or qualitattively. Qualitatively it can be described as whether a solution is dilute (relatively small quantity more quantity of solute is present) or concentrated (relatively more quantity of solute is present). To express solution quantitatively different methods need to be used.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Methods of Expressing Concentration:</h4>
		<p>There are different methods to express the concentration, quantitavely. Weight percentage, volume percentage, weight-volume percentage, molarely, normality, molality, mole fraction.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Weight of percentage:</h4>
		<p>Weight percentage is defined as the amount of solute in grams present in 100 grams of solution. In older text and references, this is sometimes referred to as weight - weight percentage or mass percentage and abbreviated as 'w/w' <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Weight \ percentage = \frac{(\text{Weight of solute}) g}{(\text{Weight of solution}) g} \times 100  \) </span>
			<br />
			In a solution, if <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  w_1  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  w_2  \) </span> are the weights of solute and solvent in grams respectively, <br />
			then <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  w/w = \frac{w_1}{w_1 + w_2} = 100  \) </span>
		</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Volume percentage:</h4>
		<p>Volume percentage is defined as the volume of solute (in ml) present in 100 ml of solution. <br />
			This method of concentration is generally used for the solutions made by mixing liquids and is abbreviated as v/v. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Volume \ percentage = \frac{(\text{Weight of solute}) ml}{(\text{Weight of solution}) ml} \times 100  \) </span>
			<br />
			In a solution, if v is the volume of solute in ml and V is the volume of solution in nil, then, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{v}{v} =  \frac{v}{V} \times 100  \) </span>
			<br />
			Hence, volume percentage decreases with the increase in temperature.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Weight - Volume percentage:</h4>
		<p>Weight - volume percentage is defined as the amount of solute (in grams) present in 100 ml of solution. This method of concentration is generally used for the solutions made from solid reagents and is abbreviated as '<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{w}{v}'  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Weight - Volume \ percentage = \frac{(\text{Weight of solute}) g}{(\text{Weight of solution}) g} \times 100  \) </span>
			<br />
			In a solution, if w is the weight of solute in grams and v is the volume of solution in millilitre, then, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{w}{v} =  \frac{w}{v} \times 100  \) </span>. <br />
			For example: 5% <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{w}{v}  \) </span> NaC1 solution means that 5 g of NaCl is present in 100 ml solution.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Effect of Temperature:</h4>
		<p> We know that, weight-volume % = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \frac{w}{v} \times 100  \) </span>. Hence, weight - volume  percentage decreases with increase in temperature.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Molarity(M)</h4>
		<p>Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute present in 1 litre of solution. It is denoted by M. It is the most common and universally accepted method of expressing concentration of a solution in analytical chemistry. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  M = \frac{\text{No.of moles of solute (n)}}{\text{Volume of solution in litres (V)}}  \\\\[3pt]

			<br />
			M = No.of milli moles / V (ml) </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Units</h5>
		<p>The units of molarity are moles / litre or millimoles/ milliliter or molar.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Advantage</h5>
		<p>It is advantageous to express the concentration in terms of molarity because of the use of moles. This enables the measurement of absolute number of particles present in a solution irrespective of their weight and volume.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Molar Solution:</h5>
		<p>A solution which contains one gram molecular weight or one mole of solute per litre of the solution is known as molar solution. <br />
			Eg: NaOH contains 1 mole (40 g) of NaOH in its 1 litre solution.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Effect of Temperature:</h5>
		<p>We know, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( M = \frac{n}{V}  \) </span>. Hence molarity decreases with increase of temperature.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Molality</h4>
		<p>It is the number of moles of solute dissolved per kg of solvent. It is denoted by m. e nu  Mathematically. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  molality(m) = \frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{\text{Weight of solvent in kg}}  \\\\[3pt]
				or \ = \frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{\text{Mass of solvent in gram}}  \times 100  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Thus, the units of molaiity are moles per kilogram i.e., <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  mol \ kg^{-1}  \) </span>. It is represented by the symbol m. <br />
			If as moles of solute are dissolved in W grams of solvent, then Molality = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{n_B}{W} \times 100  \) </span>.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Mole fraction</h4>
		<p>The ratio between number of moles of a component to the total number in the solution is called mole fraction. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  Mole \ fraction = \frac{\text{Number of moles of the component}}{\text{Total number of moles of all components}}  \\\\[3pt]

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 1:</h4>
		<p>Why are the world's major ocean fisheries located in cold regions?  <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			The main source of living for aquatic animals like fishes is the dissolved oxygen present in water. The survival becomes tough if the dissolved oxygen decreases. We know that solubility of a gas in a liquid decreases with increase of temperature or less is the temperature more is the solubility of gas (oxygen) in a liquid (water). Therefore, fishes cannot survive in warm water due to the availability of less amount of dissolved oxygen. The reverse is the reason for the location of major ocean fisheries in cold regions.</p>
