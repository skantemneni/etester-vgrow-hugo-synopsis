		<p>Matter exists as pure substances in the form of elements and compounds. Elements are made of smallest constituents as atoms whereas compounds contains molecules which are made of atoms as their constituents. The molecules are formed by the union of atoms by forces of attraction of developed between them which hold them together. This force of attraction is called a chemical bond. Chemical bonds are responsible for the existence of molecules. Compounds are made up of different kinds of molecules and there are millions of compounds.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Electro Valency Theory - Kossel and Lewi's approach of bonding</h4>
		<p>A number of attempts were made to explain the formation of chemical bonds in terms of electrons, but it was only in 1916, Kossel and Lewi's succeeded independently in giving a satisfactory explanation. They proposed a theory, based on electronic concept of atoms, known as electron theory of valency. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Postulates</h4>
		<p>Atoms with eight electrons in the outermost shell (two in case of Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium and Beryllium) are chemically more stable. The cause for chemical reaction is to attain stability. This is achieved by an atom by acquiring  the octet configuration (inert gas configuration) in its outermost shell. The electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are responsible for chemical reaction. The outermost shell is called valence shell and hence, the electrons present in it, are called valence electrons. The number of electrons taking part in a chemical reaction is called valency of that element. The atoms of various elements achieve the nearest inert gas configuration, either by transfer (losing or gaining) or by sharing of electrons with another atom. This transfer or sharing of electrons results in the development of an attractive force between the atoms, which holds the atoms together by a bond.</p>

	<p>The chemical bond formed between two atoms by the transfer of one or more electrons from the valence shell of an electropositive element to the valence shell of an electronegative element is called as ionic bond.

		<p>two types of covalent bonding are nonpolar covalent bond and polar covalent bond. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Nonpolar covalent bond </h5>
		<p>Nonpolar covalent bond is formed when equitable sharing of electrons between the bonded atoms takes place. Due to equitable sharing it does not result in any charge separation within the molecule. <br />

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Polar covalent bond </h5>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Covalency</h4>
		<p>Covalency in the number of electron pairs shared by an atom of an element in the formation of a covalent compound. <br />
			The covalent bond, formed between two atoms by the sharing one pair of electrons, is a single bond. E.g.: <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Cl_2, \ F_2,\ H_2, \ HCl  \) </span>. The covalent bond, formed between two atoms by the sharing of two pairs of electrons, is a double bond. E.g : <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  O_2, \ C_2H_4, \ CO_2  \) </span>. The covalent bond, formed between two atoms by the sharing of three pairs of electrons, is a triple bond. E.g.: <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  N_2, \ C_2H_2  \) </span>. If the central atom in a molecule does not have octet, it is called an electron deficient molecule. E.g.: <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  BCl_3, \ AlCl_3  \) </span>. In several compounds, like <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  PCl_5, \ SF_6, \ IF_7  \) </span> etc., the central atom has more than octet. So these deviate from octet rule. <br />

	<p>It was proposed by Sidgwick. An atom contributes both the electrons for mutual sharing and that electron pair is shared by the two atoms.

			Here, the atoms of A lose electrons whereas the atoms of B gain electrons. This means that there is a transfer of electrons from atoms of A to atoms of B.

			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			During the formation of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  O^{-}  \) </span> from O, an electron has to be added to the neutral atom of oxygen. This results in release of energy and hence is exothermic. It can be shown as follows:	<br />

			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   O^{-} + 1 e^{-} \rightarrow O^{-2}  \) </span>
			<br />
			The extra negative charge on <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  O^{-}  \) </span> results in repulsion , of second electron that is to be added.

			Electron configuration of 0 : 2, 6 <br />
			Each oxygen atom contributes 2 electrons for sharing.  <br />
			Electron configuration of H : 1 <br />
			Each hydrogen atom contributes 1 electron for sharing. <br />
			Therefore two hydrogen atoms are needed to contribute a total of 2 electrons for sharing. <br />
			One oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms share two pairs of electrons so that each atom can achieve a stable noble gas configuration - the oxygen atom achieves the electron configuration of neon (2, 8) while each hydrogen atom achieves the electron configuration of helium (2). <br />
			Two single bonds are formed between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms.</p>
