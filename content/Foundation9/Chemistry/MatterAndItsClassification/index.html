	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Chemistry deals with the study of matter. The study of matter involves many aspects in which the most important aspect is their classification based on chemical composition into three main categories namely elements, compounds and mixtures. The further classification of metals, nonmetals and metalloids is based on their characteristic properties. This also includes the study based on the differentiation of compounds and mixture along with their techniques of separation.</p>

<section class="skill" id="02">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Classification of Matter on the Basis of Chemical Composition</h3>
	<p>Substances which are homogeneous in nature and contain particles (molecules) of only one kind are called pure substances. A pure substance is homogeneous in nature and has definite set of properties. The composition of pure substances cannot be changed by physical methods. Pure substances can be further classified as elements and compounds.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Elements</h4>
		<p>Pure substances in which molecules are composed of only one kind of atoms are called elements. Example: silver, iron, oxygen, nitrogen etc.,</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Atomicity of an element</h4>
		<p>The number of atoms present in the molecule of an element is called its atomicity. Based on the atomicity, the elements are classified into 3 types :</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Mixtures</h4>
		<p>Most of the substances available in nature are not pure substances and they are mixtures. Mixtures are those substances which contain two or more kinds of molecules. For example, sugar solution contain molecules of sugar and molecules of water. The mixtures can have their constituents as either elements, an element and a compound or only compounds. <br/>
			Depending on the distribution of the different kinds of molecules within the mixture, they are classified into two types homogeneous and heterogeneous. Homogeneous mixtures have uniform distribution of the different types of molecules in the mixture. Solution of glucose is a homogeneous mixture and muddy water is a heterogeneous mixture. </p>
	</section>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="04">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Separation of Mixtures</h3>
	<p>The useful component present in the mixture can be obtained only by separating the individual components of the mixture by following suitable method. The method of separation employed depends upon the nature of components in the mixture. </p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Separation of solid - solid mixtures</h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Solvent extraction</h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, solubility of one component in a solvent is used. For example a mixture of sulphur and sand can be separated by this method. Here sulphur is soluble in carbon disulphide <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (CS_2)  \) </span> and sand is insoluble. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Magnetic separation</h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, magnetic property of one component is used. For example mixture of ironore and sand can be separated by this method. Here ironore is attracted by magnet and sand is left behind. </p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104480002_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Gravity method</h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, difference in densities of component is used. For example mixture of sand and chalk powder can be separated by this method. Here sand being heavier than chalk powder sinks in water whereas chalk powder floats on water.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Sublimation</h5>
		<p> In this method of separation, ability of one component to sublime is used. For example Mixture of iodine and sand can be separated by this method. Here on heating iodine sublimes leaving behind sand. The vapours on cooling give solid iodine. <br/>
			Most solids melt or change into liquid when heated. But there are some substances like camphor, ammonium chloride and naphthalene that directly change from solid to gas when heated. The process by which a solid directly changes into vapour when heated is called sublimation. The solid which sublimes will escape as a vapour while the other will be left behind. The vapour can be cooled to get the solid back again.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104480002_image-2.png" alt="image2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<h5 class="Note"> Note </h5>
		<p> The substance left behind in sublimation is called sublime. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Fractional crystallisation</h5>
		<p> In this method of separation, difference in solubility of the components in the same solvent is used. For example mixture of potassium nitrate <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (KNO_3)  \) </span> and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be separated by this method. Here potassium nitrate <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (KNO_3)  \) </span> being more soluble than sodium chloride (NaCl), when the aqueous solution of this mixture is subjected to heating and subsequent cooling the more soluble potassium nitrate <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (KNO_3)  \) </span> remains in the solution less soluble sodium chloride (NaCl) crystallizes out first.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Separation of solid - liquid mixtures</h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Sedimentation and decantation</h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, high density of insoluble solid component is used. For example mixture of sand and water can be separated by this method. Here sand being heavier settles at the bottom and liquid is slowly transferred into another container </p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104480002_image-3.png" alt="image3" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Filtration </h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, different size of the particles of insoluble solid component is used. For example mixture of barium sulphate <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (BaSO_4)  \) </span> and water <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (H_2O)  \) </span> can be separated by this method. Here on passing through filter paper, water passes through filter paper whereas barium sulphate <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (BaSO_4)  \) </span> remains on the filter paper.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104480002_image-4.png" alt="image4" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Evaporation</h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, the ability of solid to remain undecomposed when solution is heated upto the boiling point of the liquid component is the principle used. For example mixture of sugar and water can be separated by this method. Here water evaporates on heating leaving behind crystals of sugar.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104480002_image-5.png" alt="image5" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Distillation</h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, heating the solution to the boiling point of liquid component followed by condensation of the vapours is used. For example mixture of sodium chloride (NaCl) and water can be separated by this method. Here water evaporates and condensation back to water and sodium chloride (NaCl) is left behind in the distillation flask.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104480002_image-6.png" alt="image6" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Centrifugation </h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, difference in size of liquid particles is used. For example milk contains solid fat particles in water and can be separated by this method. Here size of solid particles is less and hence they pass through the filter paper. When this is subjected to centrifugation heavier fat particles settle down at the bottom leaving behind lighter water on the top.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Separation of liquid - liquid mixtures </h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Separating funnel </h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, difference in densities of the two immiscible liquid components is used. For example kerosene oil and water are immiscible liquids can be separated by this method. Here when the mixtures are taken in the separating funnel, the lighter liquid (kerosene) forms top layer and the heavier liquid (water) settles down.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104480002_image-7.png" alt="image7" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div> 
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Fractional distillation</h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, difference in boiling points of the liquids is used. The distillation is carried out by including a fractionating column. For example: Ethyl alcohol + water can be separated by this method. Ethyl alcohol has a lower boiling point than water and hence vapourizes. On passing through fractionating column the vapours condense to give alcohol in a receiver. Water is left behind in the distillation flask.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image">

		 </div>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Separation of gas - gas mixtures  </h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Diffusion </h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, difference in densities of component gases is used. The gas with lower molecular weight diffuses faster than the gas with higher molecular weight. For example hydrogen <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (H_2)  \) </span> and methane <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (CH_4)  \) </span>, helium (He) and sulphur dioxide <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (SO_2)  \) </span>. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Dissolution in suitable solvents </h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, difference in solubility of component gases in a given solvent is used. For example a mixture of carbon dioxide <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (CO_2)  \) </span> is soluble in potassium hydroxide (KOH) leaving behind carbon monoxide (CO). Here in a mixture of ammonia <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (NH_3)  \) </span> and nitrogen <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (N_2)  \) </span>, ammonia <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (NH_3)  \) </span> is soluble in water and nitrogen <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (N_2)  \) </span> is insoluble. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Preferential liquefaction </h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, difference in liquefaction of component gases in a given solvent is used. For example a mixture of ammonia <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (NH_3)  \) </span> and hydrogen <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (H_2)  \) </span>  can be separated by this method. Here, ammonia gets liquefied under high pressure and hydrogen gas is left behind. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Fractional evaporation</h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, difference in boiling points of the component gases is used. For example when air is liquefied, the major components of air, nitrogen <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ( N_2 )  \) </span> and oxygen <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ( O_2 )  \) </span> can be separated by subjecting the liquid to evaporation. Here, nitrogen <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ( N_2 )  \) </span> has a lower boiling point and hence boils off, oxygen <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ( O_2 )  \) </span> has a higher boiling point and remains behind. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Separation of liquid - gas mixtures  </h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Heating</h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, decrease in solubility of a gas with increase in temperature is used. For example when a solution containing a gas is subjected to slight heating below the boiling point of the liquid, the gas escapes out leaving behind the liquid component. For example : Separation of dissolved oxygen <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ( O_2 )  \) </span>in water by heating water.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Lowering the pressure </h5>
		<p>In this method of separation, difference in solubility of gas in the liquid at different pressures is used. For example: Soda water can be separated by this method. Here when soda water bottle is opened, the pressure inside the bottle decreases and carbondioxide <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ( CO_2 )  \) </span> gas fizzes out of the bottle.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Paper chromatography </h4>
		<p>A special technique used for separation and identification of the constituents in the mixture. The priniciple involved is based on difference in adsorption of constituents by a surface of an appropriate adsorbent material or solid medium (stationary phase). The rate of adsorption of a particular constituent depends upon its solubility in the solvent (moving phase). For example : separation of coloured constituent in a mixture of ink by paper chromatography. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Process </h5>
		<p>A filter paper is taken which generally absorbs water. It acts as stationary phase. The mixture containing different constituents is taken on the filter paper which is then dipped in another solvent called moving phase. If the constituent has more affinity for the solvent acting as moving phase, it moves rapidly on the filter paper. Therefore, depending on the relative affinities of the various constituents with the stationary phase and moving phase, spots or lines appear on the filter paper at different positions.</p>
