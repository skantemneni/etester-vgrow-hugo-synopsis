	<h3 class="skill-heading">Atmosphere and Climate</h3>
	<p>The major components of the planet Earth can be divided into water, land, and air. The land surface known as <span class="highlight01">lithosphere.</span> Water covers about 75% of the Earth's surface and is called <span class="highlight01">hydrosphere.</span> Air which covers the water and land, is known as <span class="highlight01">atmosphere.</span> These are the abiotic (non-living) components. the abiotic components interact with the biotic (living) components in the <span class="highlight01">biosphere.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Effect of atmosphere on life on Earth</span>
		<br />
		We know that the position of the Earth in the solar system and its distance from sun helps in maintaining the temperature of the Earth and thus supporting life. Moon too is located at the same distance from sun as the Earth. Yet, life does not exist on moon. The moon has extreme temperatures, which ranges from about <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( "190^{\circ} C
			to \ 110^{\circ}C, \) </span> although it is located at a similar distance from sun as the Earth. However, the Earth maintains a moderate range of temperature. This is because the Earth has an atmosphere and moon does not.Atmosphere is a mixture of gases. It is basically a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapour, and hydrogen.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">How does atmosphere maintain the temperature?</span>
		<br />Air is a bad conductor of heat. During the day, it resists the heat from entering the Earth and at night, it does not allow the heat to escape from the Earth.<br />
		Thus, the atmosphere does not allow a sudden increase in temperatures during the day and a sudden decrease in temperatures at night. This helps to maintain a moderate temperature, which is essential for life.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Formation of Wind and Rain</h3>
	<p>We can feel the presence of air although we cannot see it. We are able to see the trees and plants move due to the moving air. This movement of air is called wind. <br /> Wind can be defined as the air which moves horizontally over the surface of the Earth.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Formation of Wind</span>
	</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="104580006_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>Wind is formed as a result of the differential heating of the atmosphere.A portion of the solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface is radiated back into the atmosphere. This heats up the atmosphere. The extent of this heating varies across land and water.<br />
		<span class="highlight01">How does differential heating lead to the formation of wind?</span>
		During the day, solar radiations heat up the land surface. This causes the air over land surface to heat up.
		The hot air expands and rises upwards. This vertical movement of air is known as convection current.
		<span class="highlight01">A low pressure</span> area is thus created over land surface. The solar radiations do not heat up water as fast as they heat up land. This is because water takes a longer time to heat up as compared to land.<br />
		Therefore, during the day, when the air over the land surface is heated up, the air over the water surface is relatively cooler. This creates a <span class="highlight01">high pressure </span> area over the water surface.
		When the hot air over the land surface rises up, it creates a vacant space. This vacant space in the low pressure area (over the land) is occupied by the air present in the high pressure area (over the water). Thus, the air over the water surface starts blowing towards the land surface during the day.</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="104580006_image-2.png" alt="image2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>During the night, this situation gets reversed.<br />
		The land surface cools down much faster as compared to the water surface. Therefore, the air over land is cooler in comparison to the air over water. A high pressure area is thus created over the land surface and a low pressure area prevails over the water surface.<br />
		This causes wind to blow from the land surface towards the water surface during the night. The given animation explains the process of land breeze and sea breeze.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Did you know that hot air always moves upwards?</span>
		<br />
		Smoke is always seen rising upwards! This is because fire heats the air around it. The heated air moves upwards, carrying along burnt carbon particles that we observe as smoke. </p>

		<span class="highlight01">Formation of rain</span>
		<br />
		When the air over the land and water body heats up, water gets converted into water vapour and rises along with the air. Water vapour cools down at lower temperatures and starts condensing. This leads to the formation of clouds. Millions of tiny water droplets in the clouds keep growing in size. When these drops become so large that they can no longer be held in the clouds, they fall down as rain.Thus, during precipitation, water vapour forms rain drops.At lower temperatures, rain freezes and precipitates as snow, hail, or sleet.</p>

	<p>Water is a colourless, odourless and tasteless liquid that covers over 70% of the Earth's surface. It is present in rain, clouds and the seas. Water is not only all around us, but it is inside us as well. On an average, the human body contains almost 65% of water. Some foods are almost all water. For example, a ripe tomato consists of nearly 95% water.</p>

		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>In warm climate, seawater is evaporated in large shallow ponds called sea pans or meadows by the heat of the sun. Sea water is pumped into these pans. On evaporation, salt is left behind. This salt is called solar salt.<br />
						The slower the evaporation takes place, the larger are the crystals obtained in the pan. The mother liquor obtained after the removal of common salt crystals is called bitters and it contains magnesium salts and bromides of the sea water.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Sea provides the biggest habitat for living organisms. The majority of Earth's producers and consumers live in sea water. Phytoplankton comprising sea algae and sea plants are the major producers while zooplanktons, protozoans, crabs, fishes, sea snakes, sea turtles, crocodiles and sea birds are the primary consumers in sea water.</p>

			<span class="highlight01">The mystery of dead sea</span>
			<br />
			The dead sea is a terminal lake with no outlet, meaning water can only leave through evaporation. Water from its surrounding tributaries flow in to the dead sea. Bringing with them all sorts of minerals, including salts. Since, there is no outlet, the water evaporates depositing minerals and salts. This is the basic reason why dead sea has such high concentration and thus life cannot sustain in it.

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Formation and Importance of soil</h3>
	<p>soil is formed by the process of weathering during which rocks breaks down to form soil particles. This breaking down of rock occurs over a period of millions of years. Weathering can be physical, chemical, and biological.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Role of sun in Soil formation</span>
		<br />
		During the day,sunlight heats up the rocks on the Earth's surface  and during the night, it cools them down. Rocks expand when heated and contract when cooled down. This repeated heating and cooling of rocks causes them to break down into smaller particles. </p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Role of Water in Soil formation</span>
		<br />
		Water too aids in the process of soil formation. It enters the rocks through the cracks in them and freezes at lower temperatures. This expands and contracts the rocks, which results in the breaking down of the rocks. Another way in which water helps in the formation of soil is when running water flows along rocks. The flow of water along the rocks creates a friction between water and rocks, which results in the weathering of rocks. This leads to the formation of soil. The soil thus formed may flow along with the water and get deposited elsewhere.  </p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Role of winds in Soil formation</span>
		<br />
		Strong winds wear down or erode rocks. They carry soil particles thus formed and deposit them at places where the winds slow down.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Role of living organisms in Soil formation</span>
		<br />
		Living organisms also help in the formation of soil. Mosses and lichen break down the surface of rocks due to the action of the chemicals that they release. The roots of plants also help in the breaking down of rocks. These roots enter the rocks through the cracks in them. In course of time, as they expand and grow, they cause the break down of rocks into smaller pieces.<br /> Thus, soil formed from rocks. In other words, soil contains rock particles.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Components of Soil</span>
		<br />
		One important component of soil is the organic component comprising the dead and decaying leaves, parts of plants, and animals. This organic material decomposes to form <span class="highlight01">humus,</span> which determines the fertility of the soil. It is porous in nature and allows water to pass through it. The parent rock of the soil determines its mineral component.<br />
		Humus and the nutrient content of the soil are important factors in determining the type of plant that the soil can support. Since these factors are present in the topmost layer of the soil, it is this topsoil that essentially decides the type of plant or animal life that it can support.<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Can we alter the nutrient and humus content of the soil to support plant life?</span>
		<br />
		It is possible to increase the nutrient and humus content of the soil by using manures and fertilizers. Manures are naturally decomposed organic materials that increase soil fertility. Fertilizers are either natural or chemical in nature and add essential nutrients to the soil. The use of fertilizers is a common practice in agriculture.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Threat to Soil</span>
		<br />
		Most fertilizers and pesticides are made of chemicals. Excessive use of fertilizers and chemicals can kill the natural microorganisms present in soil. It also affects earthworms, which help in the conversion of organic   matter into  humus. If the use of fertilizers and pesticides not controlled, then soil may lose its harmful   substances that affect the useful components present in the soil, is called   soil   pollution.<br />
		Loss of the valuable topsoil during rains is another   threat   to   soil.   This   process is called <span class="highlight01">Soil erosion.</span>soil takes   millions of years to form and it can be washed away   by wind or water in no time. Plants do not grow in eroded regions because of the absence of nutrients and humus. Soil erosion thus results   in loss of plant life and converts previously fertile land into barren land.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Prevention of Soil erosion</span>
		<br />
		Plant roots help in holding the soil and preventing erosion. Therefore, plants play a very important role in maintaining the quality of topsoil. Since topsoil is difficult to recover, planting trees should be encouraged and deforestation should be avoided.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Biogeochemical Cycles</h3>
	<p>We know that plants absorb nitrogen from the soil. Assuming that all plants do so, the nitrogen in soil should have been completely exhausted by now. However, this is not the case.<br />
		Similarly, organisms breathe-in oxygen and breathe-out carbon dioxide. If all organisms inhale oxygen from the atmosphere and exhale carbon dioxide, then the atmosphere should be left with only carbon dioxide, as all the oxygen should have been exhausted. However, once again, this is not true!<br />
		To maintain the concentrations of substances in the environment, there should be a mechanism to constantly recycle these substances. These recycle mechanisms are called <span class="highlight01">biogeochemical cycles.</span>

			<br />
			There are methods that change atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms through the process of <span class="highlight01">nitrogen fixation.</span> Two such methods are given below.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>During lightning and thunder, the high temperature and pressure in the air convert atmospheric nitrogen into oxides of nitrogen that can dissolve in water to produce nitric and nitrous acids. These fall along with rain.</p>

				<li>
					<p>Certain forms of bacteria are able to convert atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms such as nitrates and nitrites. Such nitrogen fixing bacteria are commonly found in the roots of legumes (plants of pulses) inside special structures called <span class="highlight01">root nodules.</span>
					</p>

			<br />
			When plants and animals die, they start decomposing after some time. During this process, proteins are converted into nitrates and nitrites by the action of decomposing bacteria.

		<br />
		All of us have seen the TajMahal, either in reality or in pictures. <span class="highlight01">Did you know that the TajMahal is in danger because of rising air pollution levels?</span>
		Taking the TajMahal as a case study, let us explore how air pollution affects non-living objects such as buildings and monuments. The industries present around the TajMahal, especially the Mathura oil refinery, are primarily responsible for the damage caused to the monument.<br />
		Acid rains are very harmful. These rains cause widespread damage to several materials and property, especially to monuments, which undergo heavy corrosion as a result of these rains. Acid rains have corroded the marble of the Taj Mahal, a phenomenon also known as <span class="highlight01">Marble-cancer.</span>
		<br />
		This particulate matter released from Mathura oil refinery is responsible for the yellowing of the marble of the Taj Mahal.</p>

		<span class="highlight01">What are we doing to protect the Taj Mahal or other monuments from the harmful effects of air pollution? </span> Let us find out <br />
		The Supreme Court of India has taken many steps in the direction of protecting the taj mahal from pollution. It has directed the industries around the Taj Mahal to use cleaner fuels such as LPG(Liquefied petroleum Gas) and CNG (Compressed Natural Gas).	In addition, all vehicles have been ordered to switch-over to unleaded petrol. CNG and LPG are clean fuels. Hence, they do not produce soot on burning.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Water Pollution</h3>
	<p>The addition of harmful substances to water which causes its physical, chemical and biological properties to change is Called <span class="highlight01">Water pollution.</span>
		<br />
		The substances that pollute water are called water pollutants. Sewage toxic chemicals silt etc, are examples of <span class="highlight01">Water pollutants.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Sources of water pollution</span>
		<br />
		All of you are aware that Ganga is one of the most important holy rivers of India. In supports the lives of millions of people living in the northern plains. According to a study by the WWF, Ganga is one of the ten most endangered rivers.<br />
		The river Ganga is Practically dead at many places. This is because the pollution levels in the river are so high that it cannot support any life form. The portion of the river that flows through the city of Kanpur is a stretch that is completely dead.</p>
	<p> The factors that have contributed to the increase in the pollution levels of the river are</p>
	<div class="list1-ul default-spaced-indented list-bullet-style-image-square">
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Dumping of large quantities of garbage into the river</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Releasing of untreated sewage water into the river</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Throwing of dead bodies into the river.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Washing, bathing, and defecating near the shores of the river.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Throwing flowers and idols of gods and goddesses into the river</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Dumping non-biodegradable substances such as polythene bags into the river</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>These are common factors that are responsible for polluting the rivers of our country. In addition, factories manufacturing fertilizers, detergents, leather goods, and paints that are located near a river, throw their industrial wastes and toxic chemicals into the river. This makes the water of the river unfit for use by living organisms.<br />
		In order to address all the above mentioned problems, the <span class="highlight01">Ganga Action Plan</span> was launched in the year 1985 with the purpose of reviving the river. However, unplanned urbanisation and industrialization has taken its toll on the river and it has been damaged beyond repair.</p>

			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Industrial waste:</span>
					<br />
					In the absence of proper treatment facilities for industrial wastes, most of these wastes are directly dumped into the rivers. The industrial wastes from oil refineries, chemical factories, sugar mills, and fertilizer plants carry toxic substance such as arsenic, lead, mercury, and fluoride. These substances cause toxicity in plants and animals.<br />
					They also pollute the soil by increasing its acidity, decreasing its fertility, and affecting	the growth of worms whiCh are beneficial for the soil.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">pesticides and fertilizers</span>
					<br />
					We know that fertilizers and pesticides are a farmer's friend as these help in killing the pests and weeds and increasing the fertility of the soil. The chemicals that are contained in these pesticides and fertilizers get dissolved in the water and eventually get washed away to the water bodies. They also seep into the ground and pollute the ground water.<br />
					On entering the water bodies, these pesticides and fertilizers increase the nutrient content of the soil as they contain various nutrients. This accelerates the growth of algae in the water bodies. You may have observed that some bodies appear green in colour. This because of the excessive growth of algae in water.<br />
					When these algae die, they are decomposed by the action of micro-organisms that are present in water. Consequently, the number of these micro-organisms in water bodies increases. Since they consume a large quantity of oxygen that is present in the water, it leads to a decrease in the levels of oxygen. The absence of oxygen eventually leads to the death of the living organisms.   </p>

				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Sewage</span>
					<br />Sewage is waste water that contains faecal matter, urine, food	wastes, detergents, and other solid substances. Sewage contains many disease-causing pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites. When drinking water gets contaminated with sewage water, these harmful organisms enter the bodies of the living organisms and cause several diseases. Some of the diseases caused by the drinking of contaminated water and the names of the respective causal organisms are listed in the table.</p>

		<span class="highlight01">Conservation and Purification Of Water</span>
		<br />
		Water is a precious resource and we need to conserve it. Water can be conserved by following the simple principle of reduce, reuse, and recycle. This can be practiced easily at homes. Some examples are</p>
	<div class="list1-ul default-spaced-indented list-bullet-style-image-square">
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Reusing the waste water from the kitchen (water that has been used to wash vegetables etc.) to water the plants in the garden</p>

			<li>
				<p>Turning the tap off while brushing or shaving</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Checking for leaky taps and fixing them up</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>Thus, we can reduce the total amount of water consumed by us by recycling and reusing most of the waste water for other purposes.<br />
		The waste water from industries first needs to be treated in sewage treatment plants. This water can then be used for growing plants and other industrial purposes.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Purification of water</span>
		<br />
		Potable water is the water that is safe for drinking. Although the water may look clean on more observation, it may contain disease-carrying micro-organisms. In order to prevent the occurrence of diseases, this water has to be cleaned and only then can it be used safely for drinking. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Greenhouse Effect</h3>
	<p>Have you seen a greenhouse in a nursery where plants are kept? A greenhouse is a structure that traps the sun's heat and does not allow it to escape. This provides a warm atmosphere for the plants to grow.</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="104580006_image-10.png" alt="image10" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>We know that the sun's rays keep the Earth's surface warm. Some of the solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth, while a part of it is reflected back into space. This reflected radiation is trapped by the atmosphere of the Earth. This phenomenon, which imitates the greenhouse of a nursery, is known as the <span class="highlight01">greenhouse effect.</span>
		<br />
		<span class="highlight01">How does the greenhouse effect affect our environment?</span>
		<br />
		There are a few gases in the atmosphere that aggravate the greenhouse effect. These gases are called greenhouse gases. The levels of these gases in the atmosphere have increased as a result of increasing pollution levels. Carbon dioxide is one of the gases that cause the greenhouse effect.<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Carbon dioxide <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (CO_2) \) </span> is a natural component of the atmosphere. How can a natural part of the Earth pose a threat to life?</span>
		All of us know that plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to synthesize their own food through the process of photosynthesis. However, as a result of deforestation, the number of trees has gone down drastically.<br />
		This has reduced the uptake of carbon dioxide by trees, which in turn has led to an increase in its concentration in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels further adds to the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. As a result, more and more solar radiation is being trapped in the atmosphere, thereby leading to an increase in the Earth's temperature. This warming-up of the Earth is termed as <span class="highlight01">global warming.</span> Other gases such as methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapour also contribute to the greenhouse effect.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">What are the likely consequences of global warming?</span>
		<br />
		Global warming will result in extreme temperature conditions. There will be changes in the precipitation patterns that may lead to floods and droughts. The water trapped in the ice caps of the Polar Regions will start melting at a rapid rate, which will cause the sea levels to rise.<br />
		Even a marginal increase in the temperature of the Earth <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (i.e., +0.5^{\circ}C) \) </span> may lead to serious disasters.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Importance Of Ozone Layer</span>
		<br />
		Did you know that there is an increase in the incidence of skin cancer? Did you know that one of the main causes of skin cancer is an increased exposure to the <span class="highlight01">ultraviolet radiations</span> from the sun? Sun is very important for life on the Earth. It has been in existence from the very time life started on the planet Earth. Sun provides the optimum temperatures for the existence of life on our planet. Why then is there an increase in the occurrence of skin cancer causes now? <span class="highlight01">To answer this question, let us understand the importance of the ozone layer.</span> Ozone <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (O_3) \) </span> is a form of oxygen and is more stable than the two-atom oxygen <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (O_2). O_3 \) </span> is a tri-atomic molecule of oxygen. The ozone layer is found in the atmosphere at a height of about 15 to 30 km from the surface of the Earth.<br />
		Ozone is a poisonous gas that has harmful effects on the respiratory system of animals. However, this gas protect us from the harmful<span class="highlight01">ultraviolet radiations</span> of sun.<br />
		The ozone layer protects and prevents these ultraviolet radiations from reaching the Earth's surface.<br />
		Some of the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiations are given below.</p>
	<div class="list1-ul default-spaced-indented list-bullet-style-image-square">

	<p>This useful ozone layer is getting depleted as a result of pollution. The pollutants that are responsible for depleting the ozone layer are gases such as chlorine and fluorine.</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image"> 
		<img src="104580006_image-11.png" alt="image11" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
	 </div>
	<p>These gases are stable and are not broken down by any biological process. When these gases reach the ozone layer, they break the bonds between the three atoms of oxygen in ozone, thereby leading to the destruction of the ozone molecule. This process gradually results in <span class="highlight01">ozone depletion.</span> As a result of ozone depletion, a hole has developed in the ozone layer over Antarctica and its size has been steadily increasing over the years.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Initiatives to Reduce Air Pollution and Global Warming</span>
		<br />
		Air pollution and global warming pose a serious threat to the Earth.<br />
		<span class="highlight01">What initiatives can we take to reduce these problems?</span>
		<br />
		The government of Delhi has taken several initiatives to reduce the levels of air pollution in the city. Delhi was ranked among the most polluted cities of the world till a	it few years ago. The air in the city was heavily laden with fumes and poisonous gases from automobiles. On the intervention of the Supreme Court, a  decision was taken to introduce CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) as a fuel to run the public transport system of Delhi. In addition, the use of unleaded petrol was made compulsory. The results of these initiatives reflected in the quality of air. The air in Delhi now is much cleaner as compared to the past. Thus, the use of CNG	and unleaded petrol are a few of the measures that can be taken to reduce air pollution.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01"> Measures to help combat air pollution </span>
		<br />
		One measure of preventing air pollution and global warming involves <span class="highlight01">switching over from traditional fuels to alternative, cleaner fuels</span> such as solar energy, wind energy, and hydropower energy. Unlike fossil fuels, these alternative sources of energy do not cause pollution and can be tapped from nature, where these are available in abundance.<br />
		The burning of dry leaves causes a lot of pollution. Therefore, instead of burning them, one can bury these leaves in a compost pit. The leaf compost thus obtained can be used as manure for plants.<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Planting of trees </span> is another measure that can be taken to reduce air pollution. Plants use carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Thus, planting more trees will increase the utilization of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This will reduce the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere and will help in reducing the growing effects of global warming. In India, Van Mahotsav is celebrated every year during the rainy season in the months of July and August. During this period, large scale plantation of trees is carried out.</p>
