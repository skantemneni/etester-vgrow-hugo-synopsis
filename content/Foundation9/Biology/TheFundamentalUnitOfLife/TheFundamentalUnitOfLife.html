		<p>All living organisms are made up of cells. The Cell is the structural and functional unit of life It is the smallest living entity found in living organisms.<br />
			The term cell was introduced by Robert Hooke in 1665, while examining a slice of cork through his microscope. Cork is obtained from the bark of a tree. Under a compound microscope, he observed many small compartments resembling like a honeycomb. He termed these as cells. The given table lists some properties of cells.</p>

					<p>As division of labour exists in multicellular organisms, a variety of tasks can be performed efficiently. This gives the organism a wide range of adaptability to survive.</p>

					<p>In multicellular organisms, dead cells play an important role. For example, dead epidermal cells in the skin of animals protect the underlying cells.</p>

			Division of labour suggests the specialized functions of organs. All organs, tissues, or cells cannot carry out all the functions. They are evolved to carry out a specific set of functions. Each organ system coordinates with the other to carry out functions required for life. Therefore, by dividing the work or function, they minimize the load of carrying out all functions and therefore, they work or function efficiently.<br />

Protoplasm consists of the <span class="highlight01">cytoplasm</span> and the <span class="highlight01">nucleus</span>. Cytoplasm is the cellular matrix in which the nucleus is suspended.

		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Do you know how nutrients are absorbed in the digestive tract</span>?<br />
			In the digestive tract, food is broken down into simpler products such as glucose. Nutrients are then absorbed by the intestinal cells through a process known as diffusion.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Do you know how oxygen reaches the cells in the human body</span>?<br />
			The inhaled air contains oxygen. In the lungs, oxygen diffuses through the blood capillaries and reaches the red blood cells. There, it binds with haemoglobin to form oxy-haemoglobin. Oxy-haemoglobin is then circulated throughout the body. In tissues, where oxygen concentration is lesser than blood orthe red blood cells, oxygen diffuses out of it and enters into tissues and then into cells.<br /> 
			<span class="highlight01">Osmosis</span>

			<span class="highlight01">Osmosis</span>is the movement of water molecules across a semi-permeable membrane from a higher to a lower concentration.<br />

			<span class="highlight01">What do you observe?</span>
			<br />
			After five minutes, you will observe that the raisins swell up in the first beaker. Pure water does not contain salt. Thus, to maintain equilibrium, water enters into the raisins. This swells up the raisins. <br />
			In the second beaker, you will see no change in the raisins. An isotonic solution contains similar salt concentration as that of raisins. This produces osmotic balance. Hence, no change can be observed. In the third beaker, you will observe that the raisins shrink. This beaker contains a hypertonic solution. To maintain equilibrium, water moves out ofthe raisins. This shrinks the raisins. Excessive shrinkage results in the breakdown of the membrane. This phenomenon is called plasmolysis.</p>

	<p>We often hear of scientists producing clones.<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Do you know what clones are? Do you know how clones are created</span>?<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Cloning </span> refers to an identical copy of something. In biology, clones signify genetically identical organisms. The nucleus holds the genetic material. Therefore, if the nucleus is similar in two cells, then they would be similar. Hence, clones are produced by obtaining the nucleus from the cells of donor organisms.<br />
		The nucleus, thus obtained, is reintroduced inside the cell whose nucleus is removed. These cells are allowed to grow by providing all the required conditions. Some of these cells divide, producing a zygote. This zygote is then placed inside the uterus of a female recipient to give birth to a baby. Thus, the baby born is identical to the donor organism (whose nucleus is used) and is said to be a clone of the donor.<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Have you ever seen a nucleus?</span>
		<br />
		Nucleus is visible under a light microscope. It is acidic in nature. Any basic stain can be used to see the nucleus. Take a toothpick and spool out the materials gently from the inner surface of your cheek. Spread the materials on a clean glass slide and dry it. Add a few drops of methylene-blue solution to the material for staining. After staining, place a cover slip on the material and observe under the microscope.<br />
		<span class="highlight01">What do you observe?</span>
		<br />
		You will observe numerous round-shaped cells, which are light blue in colour. Inside each cell, a nucleus can be observed as a dark blue coloured structure.<br />
		The nucleus is the largest organelle present in the eukaryotic cells. In mammalian cells, the size of the nucleus typically varies from 11 to 22 gm in diameter. It is spherical in shape.</p>

		Thus, the nucleus controls all life activities. The entire segment of the DNA present is not always functional. The functional regions are calledgenes.<br />
		<span class="highlight01">Role of the nucleus in cellular reproduction and heredity</span>
		<br />
		Genetic material is present inside the nucleus. The nucleus plays an important role in cellular reproduction as it divides and passes the genetic material to the offspring. The genetic material decides both the appearance and the function of cells. Therefore, heredity depends upon the division of nucleus.</p>
