	<p>A tissue is a group of similar or dissimilar cells engaged in similar functions. All multicellular organisms including plants possess tissues. In plants, there are two major types of tissues-meristematic and permanent.<br />
		Meristematic tissue, also known as meristem, is composed of immature and continuously dividing cells. <br />
		In plants, shoot and root tips are made up of meristematic tissues. <br />

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Permanent Tissues</h3>
	<p>Are flowers, stems, and roots composed of the same types of tissues or cells? No. They have different functions. Therefore, they should have different cells to perform specific functions.<br />
		A flower cannot change into a leaf and a leaf cannot change into a stem. Therefore, component tissues are permanent and do not differentiate.<br />
		Permanent tissues are composed of mature cells, which have lost their power of division. Cells in a permanent tissue attain definite shape, size, and functions. They may be dead or living. Permanent tissues are derived from meristematic tissues.<br />

		<p>Observe a cactus plant (or any other desert plant). On feeling the plant surface, you will find that it is covered with a waxy layer of cut in. This is an adaptation to prevent loss of water as deserts have very less rainfall and desert plants need to conserve water.<br />
			Large trees have a hard covering called bark.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Animal Tissues</h3>
	<p>We breathe with the help of specialised cells called muscle cells. The contraction and relaxation of these cells result in movement. During breathing we inhale oxygen. This oxygen is absorbed in the lungs and then is transported to all the body cells through blood. Blood flows and carries various substances from one part of the body to the other. For example, it carries oxygen and food to all cells. It also collects wastes from all parts of the body and carries them to the liver and kidney for disposal. Blood and muscles are both examples of tissues found in our body. On the basis of the functions they perform we can think of different types of animal tissues, such as epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and nervous tissue. You can see the chart showing the classification of animal tissues.</p>

<section class="skill" id="07">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Epithelial Tissues</h3>
	<p>The human body performs different types of functions. Since different cells perform different functions, the body must have many cells to perform one or more specific functions. Tissues are broadly classified into four different groups, namely <span class="highlight01">epithelial, connective, muscular,and nervous tissues</span>. Let us explore epithelial tissues in detail.<br />

		Based on different shapes of epithelial cells, epithelium can be broadly classified as <span class="highlight01">squamous epithelium </span> columnar epithelium, and cuboidal epithelium.</p>

				</li>
				<li>

				<li>
					<p>Columnar epithelial cells are often marked by the presence of cilia. Cilia are hair-like projections coming out of cells. Cilia can move freely. This helps the mucus to move forward. These cells are called ciliated columnar epithelium.</p>
