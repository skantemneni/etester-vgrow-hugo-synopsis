	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>In our lower classes, we have observed that cells are the fundamental units of living organisms. They are made of a variety of chemical substances such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats or lipids and so on. We have also seen that each living cell is a dynamic place.<br />
		Things are always happening there. For instance, cells move from place to place. Even if a cell is not activities are going e.g., the heart is beating to pump blood to all body parts, the lungs are breathing to exchange gases, the kidneys are filtering the blood and making the urine and brain is thinking.<br />
		All these activities of various body organs are Interconnected. If kidneys, for example, stop filtering the blood, poisonous substances will accumulate in the body. Under such conditions, the brain will not be able to think properly. For all these interconnected activities, energy and raw material are needed from out side the body. In other words, food is necessary for cell and tissue functions.Anything that prevents proper functioning of the cells and tissues will lead to a lack of proper activities of the body. </p>

					<p>All viruses live inside host cells, whereas bacteria very rarely do.</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Antibiotics commonly block biochemical pathways important for bacteria</p>

					<p>Viruses do not use these pathways at all, that is why antibiotics do not work against viral infection. For example, if we have a common cold, taking of antibiotics does not reduce the severity or duration of disease.

		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Once someone has a disease, its body functions are damaged and may never recover complete.</p>

				<li>
					<p>The person suffering from an infectious disease can serve as the source from where the infection may spread to other people.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Visualizing these difficulties, prevention of diseases is far better than their cure. There are following two ways of prevention of diseases, one is general another is specific one.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">General ways of prevention of infectious diseases.</h5>
		<p>Public hygiene is one basic key to the prevention of infectious diseases. Thus, in this method of prevention of diseases, following practices are adopted:</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>For air-borne microbes, we can prevent exposure by providing living conditions that are not overcrowded.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>For water-borne microbes, we can prevent exposure by providing safe drinking water.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>For vector-borne infections, we can provide clean environments. Such a clean environment, for example, would not allow mosquito breeding.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Specific ways of prevention of infectious diseases.</h5>
		<p>Immune system and immunisation: Children escape infection of cold and cough because the immune system of their bodies is normally fighting off the microbes (pathogenic microorganisms). These cells go into action each time infecting microbes enter the body. If these cells are successful.</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>The immune cells (WBCs) manage to kill off the infection long before it assumes major proportions.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Becoming exposed to infection or be infected with an infectious microbe does not necessarily mean developing noticeable disease.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>One way of looking at severe infectious disease is that it represents failure of the immune system. The functioning of the immune system, like any other system in the body, will not be good enough if proper and sufficient nourishment and food is not available.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Therefore, second basic principle of prevention of infectious disease is the availability of proper and sufficient food for everyone.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Antibiotics</h3>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Antibiotics are chemicals produced by micro organisms (mainly bacteria and fungi) which at low concentrations have the ability to inhibit or destroy pathogens. The first antibiotic was penicillin, which was developed in the 1940's in response to the need to treat soldiers in the Second World War. There are now about 50 to 100 commercially available antibiotics.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Antibiotics are characterised by their range of effectiveness and their mode of action against the pathogens:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span class="highlight01">Broad spectrum</span> antibiotics kill a wide range of bacteria.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span class="highlight01">Narrow spectrum </span> antibiotics are effective against only a few types of bacteria.<br />
							To kill a specific pathogen, you have to use a narrow spectrum antibiotics which is specific for the disease.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>All antibiotics must have selective <span class="highlight01">toxicity.</span> This means they should kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria or fungi, but cause little or no damage to the host.<br />
					Antibiotics tend to interfere with the growth or metabolism of the pathogen in a variety of ways.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span class="highlight01">Penicillin</span> inhibits the enzymes that are involved in the formation of the bacterial cell wall. Bacteria with weak cell walls die due to leakage of the cell contents.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span class="highlight01">Streptomycin</span> binds to bacterial ribosomes, so preventing protein synthesis, including synthesis of the enzymes. The lack of protein affects bacteria metabolism and results in its death. Fortunately, bacterial ribosomes are different from human ones. So streptomycin does not interfere with the synthesis of proteins in the cells of the patient (= host) taking the drug.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span class="highlight01">Tetracyclines</span> also work by interfereing with bacterial ribosomes.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span class="highlight01">Polymixines</span> damage bacterial cell (plasma) membranes even in resting cells (spores). Penicillin. Antibiotics tend to be used against bacterial infections more than the fungal infections. This is because fungal cells work in a similar manner to human cells. As a result, many antifungal agents are highly toxic to humans.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Derivation of term vaccination</h4>
		<p>Three centuries ago, an English physician Edward Jenner (1749-1823) realised that milkmaids had cowpox did not catch smallpox even during epidemics. He tried deliberately giving cowpox to people, and found that they were now resistant to the smallpox virus. This was because the smallpox virus is closely related to the cowpox virus. 'Cow' is 'vacca' in Latin, and a cowpox is 'vaccinia'. From these roots, the word vaccination has come into our</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">How are vaccines made?</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">A vaccine is an antigen that is injected or swallowed </span>It causes the development of active immunity in the patient. The small quantities of antigen introduced into the person's body stimulate the production of antibodies as if infected by the disease. This type of immunity is long term since the body is able to produce memory cells in the natural pathway.<br />
			Antigens are treated before being introduced to the body of the person, in order to make them relatively harmless. Most vaccines are made in one of the following ways:</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Killed virulent organisms</span>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>In this case, the bacteria is killed by heat or use by chemicals, which denature its enzymes.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>So the dead pathogen will not cause the disease, but it will possess antigenic sites on its surface that will be recognised by T-and B-lymphocytes, and result in the production of antibodies in the recipient.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>There is no chance of the pathogen replicating and causing infection.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Example: Vaccine for whooping cough-bacteria.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Live non-virulent strains</span>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Vaccines made in this way are often called <span class="highlight01">attenuated (= weaken) vaccines.</span>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>In such vaccines, the pathogen is deliberately weakened to ensure that it does not cause severe infection.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Examples: Rubella, BCG vaccine used against tuberculosis and the Sabin vaccine used against poliomyelitis, which is taken orally.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Modified toxins</span>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>In this type of vaccine, the toxoids (toxic substances) produced by the bacteria are made harmless.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Toxoids are used to stimulate antibody production, but there is no risk of infection by the pathogen.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Example: Vaccines used against diphtheria and tetanus.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Isolated antigen</span>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Sometime important antigens are separated from the microorganism, in this case by breaking up the pathogen's structure and obtaining glycoproteins.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The <span class="highlight01">"flu vaccine"</span> contains a mixture of antigens from various strains of influenza virus, in an attempt to combat the great variations that exists.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>This antigenic variation occurs in microorganisms that have a high mutation rate.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Example: Influenza.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Genetically engineered antigens</span>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>In this most modern type of vaccine, restriction endonuclease enzymes are used to extract from the pathogen the genes that code for a particular antigen.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Such genes are inserted in a harmless plasmid vector using a ligase enzyme.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The bacterial cells then replicate to produce large amounts of antigen.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Since AIDS virus reduces the natural immunity of the human body, therefore, the patients suffering from AIDS becomes prone to many other infections or diseases.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The patients suffering from AIDS die from other infections (called secondary infections).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Death occurs because the patient's body cannot resist the attack of pathogens of secondary infections since patient's natural defence mechanism has been destroyed by AIDS virus.<br />
					Transmission. AIDS disease spreads among human beings by the following ways</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The AIDS disease usually spreads through unprotected (i.e., without the use of condom; condom is a membranous penile sheath of rubber having an anti-veneral or contraceptive function) sexual contact with an infected person carrying AIDS virus. Thus, AIDS is a sexually transmitted viral disease.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The AIDS disease also spreads through the transfusion of blood contaminated with AIDS virus.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The AIDS disease also spreads through the use of infected needles for injections (i.e., sharing of infected injection needles which have not been sterilised).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>An AIDS infected mother can transmit the virus to her child during pregnancy or during birth (i.e., by mother's blood). This is called vertical transmission.</p>

				<p>Poliomyelitis or polio is a disease of the nervous system caused by one of the smallest known virus, called polio virus.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In CNS, the virus destroys the motor nerve cells of spinal cord that are responsible for the muscular control. Therefore, the muscles of polio-infected person become unable to carry out the normal functions.</p>

			<li>
				<p>Polio is a kind of paralysis and it affects more to the legs.</p>
			</li>
			<li>

					<p>This programme uses oral polio vaccine or OPV.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>As per the National Immunisation Schedule (NIS), a dose of 3 drops (0.5 ml) is given orally to the child, i.e., one dose each at 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 month's age.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Finally, a booster dose is given at the age of 1.5 years.</p>

Meanwhile, a doctor should be called in who will give some antibiotic treatment. In children, diarrhoea  can be prevented by keeping clean surroundings, clean milk and feeding bottles and by following proper <br />

				<p>Peptic ulcers are painful bleeding areas in stomach and duodenum.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Robin Warren a Perth based Australian pathologist observed in 1984 that areas of peptic ulcers contained many small curved gram negative bacterium, named Helicobacter pylori</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Barry Marshall , a young clinical fellow of Warren succeeded in culturing the bacteria (1985).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Marshall and Warren (1985) found that amoxicillin, an antibiotic effective in killing the bacteria could also cure the peptic ulcers.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The finding helped in changing once painful chronic and disabling condition into short duration treatable disease. For this breakthrough Marshall and Warren were awarded Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine in 2005.</p>

			<li>
				<p>Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by a rod-shaped non-motile bacterium called Bacillus anthracis.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>This disease commonly occurs in wild and domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goat, horses and pigs.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Anthrax can spread by eating under-cooked meat of infected animals.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Human beings can also contract infection from animal products such as bones, wool, hide and bristles. B. anthraces produces an extra-cellular toxin.</p>
