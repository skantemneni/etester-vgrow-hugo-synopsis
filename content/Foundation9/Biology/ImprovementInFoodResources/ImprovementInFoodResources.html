	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>You must have heard people discussing about the requirement to improve ways of crop production. <span class="highlight01">Do you know why we require devising methods to improve production of crops to obtain a better yield?</span> This is because our country is over-populated and supports around one billion people. Therefore,in order to feed such a large population, we have to improve the methods of crop production to obtain a better crop yield.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Types of crops</h4>
		<p> Crops are plants which are cultivated by humans for food, folder, fiber, flowers, timber, etc. There are about 2000 plant species which are cultivated for eating purposes. Following parts of the plants are eaten as food.<br />
			Seeds. Not all seeds of plants are edible. For example, large seeds such as those from a lemon pose a choking hazard, whereas seeds from apple and cherries contain poison cyanide. Edible seeds include cereals, pulses, oil seeds and nuts (dry fruits). </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Crop variety improvements methods</h3>
	<p>A farmer grows two varieties of rice, one which produces nutritionally-rich grains during the monsoon season and the other which produces nutritionally-poor grains in all seasons.<br />
		He begins to wonder if he could grow nutritionally-rich grains in all seasons. Do you think it is possible? <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Hybridization </span> is the method by which two characteristics present in different organisms can be brought together into one organism. <br />
		Therefore, a hybrid plant produced from two varieties will have characteristics from both the parent plants. Therefore, it will be able to produce nutritionally-rich grains, which can be cultivated throughout the year.<br />
		Genes are responsible for the features present in an organism. Therefore, another method to grow plants with the desired characteristics is to incorporate genes responsible for that character into plants. This method will result in the production of <span class="highlight01"> genetically modified plants.</span>
		<br />
		Can you tell what other characteristics are desired in plants? <br />
		India is a country with varied regions. Certain regions are very fertile while others are dry with very low rainfall. Hence, all crop plants cannot grow in all regions. Therefore, crop plants that produce high yields in all regions with different conditions have to be produced. <br />
		Take a handful of beans and sow them in soil. Water the soil regularly and allow the beans to grow. You will observe that all plants do not grow together. Some grow faster while others grow much later. Imagine this problem in a vast farm land. If a farmer sows seeds and they do not grow uniformly, then they would not mature uniformly and he would not be able to harvest the yield at the same time. Therefore, seeds that germinate under similar conditions have to be produced.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Factors that affect the growth of crop plants</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Rainfall:</span> The amount of rainfall affects the crop plants i.e., flood and drought conditions affect the growth of crop plants.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Soil condition:</span> In coastal regions (sometimes in other regions too), soil has a high salt content. Therefore, producing plants, which can resist a high salt content in soil, is beneficial. <br />
			The problems caused by non-living factors are termed as <span class="highlight01">abiotic stress </span>. The produced plants, which can resist them, are called <span class="highlight01">abiotic stress resistant plants.</span>
			<br />
			Some abiotic stress resistant plants produced are</p>

		</div>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Disease:</span> Plants are attacked by insects, nematodes, and other disease-causing microbes, which can decrease the yield. Therefore, producing plants, which can resist the attack by pathogens, is beneficial. The problems caused by living factors are termed as biotic stress. The produced plants, which can resist them, are called biotic stress resistant plants. <br />
			Biotic stress-resistant plants that are produced are called disease resistant plants.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Changing maturity time</h4>
		<p>By growing a plant that grows and yields faster, the crop cycle is reduced to increase profits. This reduces the cost that a farmer incurs during crop production. Uniform maturity allows the farmer to harvest crops together.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Other agronomical factors</h4>
		<p>Tall branching plants are beneficial for plants whose leaves are to be utilized (for example, fodder crops that are grown to feed farm animals). <br />
			Short plants are beneficial in cereals so that nutrition is not consumed by plants to grow taller.</p>

<section class="skill" id="04">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Crop production management</h3>
	<p>In India, as in many other agriculture-based countries, farming ranges from small to very large farms. Different farmers thus have more or less land, money and access to information and technologies. In short, it is the money or financial conditions that allow farmers to take up different farming practices and agricultural technologies. There is a correlation between higher inputs and yields. Thus, the farmer's purchasing capacity for inputs decides cropping system and production practices. Therefore, production practices can be at different levels. They include 'no cost' production, 'low cost' production and 'high cost' production practices.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Nutrient Management</h3>
	<p>Observe a plant growing in your garden. What are the sources from which a plant obtains nutrition? A plant is exposed to air. Its roots are present in soil. Water is obtained from soil or provided by us. Therefore, the sources of nutrients for plants are as follows.</p>

		<p>When nutrients are not available to plants, physiological activity (such as growth, reproduction, and vulnerability to diseases) increases. Providing proper quantity of nutrients to plants ensures proper growth. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">But what are the ways by which nutrients can be added to soil?</span> Soil can be replenished and the lost nutrients can be retrieved by adding <span class="highlight01"> manures and fertilizers.</span> Let us learn about them.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Manure</h4>
		<p>Collect kitchen waste, plant waste, ash, newspaper, food scraps, etc. Mix them with soil and add some water. Stir and mix the contents regularly. Allow the materials to decompose. This mixture is rich in organic matter, renders soil fertile, and promotes luscious growth of plants.<br />
			This mixture is called manure. Therefore, manure is decomposed animal and plant waste. It increases the water-holding capacity of soil.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Composition of manure</h4>
		<p>Manure is a source of many plant nutrients. It is composed of organic matter and minerals. Ammonia, nitrate, organic substances, etc. are predominant organic matters found in manures. Manures are mostly composed of micronutrients such as zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), etc.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Advantages of manures</h4>
		<p>Manures affect the soil in following three ways:</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Manures enrich the soil with nutrients. They replenish the general deficiency of nutrients	in the soil. Since manures contain fewer nutrients they need to be used in large quantities.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Manures add organic matter (called hurus) to the soil which restores the soil texture, for better retention of water and aeration of soil. For example, organic matter present in the manures increases the water holding capacity in sandy and drainage in clayey soil. They also prevent water logging in clay soils.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The organic matter in manures provided food for the soil organisms, (decomposes such as bacteria, fungi, etc.) which help in providing nutrients to plants. Thus, organic manures help to improve the physical properties of soil, reduce soil erosion, increase the moisture holding capacity of soil and are low cost nutrient carries. Using biological waste material is a way of re-cycling the farm waste. Manures protect our environment from synthetic chemicals (i.e., fertilizers).</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Disadvantages of manures</h4>
		<p>Manures are bulky with low nutrient content. The nutrients get released slowly, unable to fulfill the high and rapid demand of nutrients required by improved high-yielding hybrid varieties of crops. Being bulky and voluminous, they are inconvenient to handle, store and transport. Moreover, manures are not nutrient specific and hence, are not much useful when a particular nutrient is required in the soil for a particular crop.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">

		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>

					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Farmyard manure (FYM)</span> FYM is the decomposed mixture of cattle excreta, (dung), urine, litter (i.e., bedding material used in night under cattle) and left over organic matter such as roughage, or fodder. These waste materials are collected daily from the	cattle shed and stored in pit for decomposition by the microorganisms (bacteria, fungi,	etc).FYM contains nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. A well decomposed farmyard manure contains about 0.5 per cent nitrogen (N), 0.2 per cent phosphorus pentaoxide <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (P_2O_5)  \) </span> and 0.5 per cent potassium monoxide <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (K_2O)  \) </span>.</p>

It takes about 3 to 6 months for decomposition of organic refuse. The nutrient contents of town compost are about 1.4 per cent nitrogen (N), 1.0 per cent phosphorus pentaoxide <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (P_2O_5)  \) </span> and 1.4 percent potassium monoxide <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (K_2O)  \) </span>.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Fertilizers</h4>
		<p>Fertilizers provide plant nutrients, commercially manufactured using chemicals. Fertilizers supply nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK). They are used for good vegetative growth (i.e., growth of leaves, branches and flowers), giving rise to healthy plants. Fertilizers are one of the major components for obtaining higher yields especially in expensive farming practices. Fertilizers contain much higher amount of nutrients in comparison to the manures and are, therefore, used in very small quantities. A complete fertilizer is one which contains all the three critical elements or minerals, nitrogen, phosphorus and (e.g., ammonium sulphate) or organic compounds (e.g., urea). On the basis of the availability of nutrients from them, fertilizers are divided into following four groups:</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Nitrogen fertilizers</span>These fertilizers supply the macronutrient. Examples of nitrogenous fertilizers are:

							</li>
							<li>
								<p> Ammonium sulphate, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (NH_4)_2SO_4  \) </span>;</p>

								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>

						<span class="highlight01">Phosphatic fertilizers.</span>. They are the source of the macronutrient phosphorus. Examples of phosphatic fertilizers are:
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>Singe superphosphate; </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Triple super phosphate;</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p> Dicalcium phosphate.</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Potassic fertilizers.</span> These fertilizers supply potassium which is one of the essential macronutrient of the plants. Examples of potassic fertilizers are:<br />
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>Muriate of potash or potassium chloride, KCI;</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p> Potassium sulphate,  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( K_2SO_4  \) </span>; </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p> Potassium nitrate  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  KNO_3  \) </span>.</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Complex fertilizers. </span> When a fertilizer contains at least two or more nutrients <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (N, P_2O_5 \ and \ K_2O)  \) </span>, it is called complex fertilizer. Examples of complex fertilizers are:
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>Nitrophosphate;</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Ammonium phosphate, </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Use ammonium phosphate.</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Fertilizers should be applied scientifically, in terms of proper dose, time pre-and post application precautions for their complete utilization. For example, sometimes due to excessive water, fertilizer gets washed away and do not get fully absorbed by the plants. Fertilizers generally get washed off through irrigation, rainfall as drainage, and pollute rivers, lakes, streams (causing toxicity, algal bloom and eutrophication) and disturbing the ecosystem. The water of these water bodies becomes unfit for human consumption and even kills the aquatic such as fishes. So, chemical fertilizers must be used carefully and judiciously.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Irrigation Farming</h3>
	<p>Rainfall in India is seasonal, but farming is practised throughout the year. During summers and winters, how do farmers supply water to their agricultural lands?<br />
		Farmers supply water to their agricultural lands by using ground water or from a nearby reservoir. The method of providing water is known as irrigation. <br />
		Irrigation is the process in which water requirement, usually for agricultural activities, is met from sources other than rain water.<br />
		Earlier, rain water was the only source for meeting the water requirements of the growing crops. But, scarcity of rain resulted in low crop yielding. Thus, more methods were developed in order to improve water availability for crop production. This helped in better irrigation management, which led to a higher yield of crops. </p>

				<li>
					<p>Irrigation of crop fields is necessary to provide sufficient moisture for the germination of seeds, as seeds do no germinate in dry soils.</p>

					<p>
						Irrigation dependent on the nature of the crop plants (i.e., crop-based irrigation)</p>

		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Crop based irrigation. </span> Water requirements of different crops are different during the various stages of their growth and maturation (ripening). Some crop plants require more water, while others need less water. For example, paddy crop (rice crop) is transplanted in standing water (wet lands) and requires continuous water supply, whereas, other crops such as wheat, gram and cotton requires less water. For cereals such as wheat, irrigation is required before ploughing the field (i.e., before tilling), at the time of flowering and at the time of development of the grain.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Soil based irrigation. </span> Irrigation also depends on the nature of the soil in which crop is grown. The crops grown in a sandy soil need irrigation more frequently, whereas the frequency of irrigation is comparatively less for crops grown in a clayey soil. Let us find out why this occurs! Sandy soil is highly porous, and has high permeability. When the crop plants standing in a sandy soil are irrigated, water quickly percolates down the soil and the crop plants are not able to absorb adequate amounts of water. So, due to the poor water retaining capacity of the sandy soil, the crops cultivated in sandy soil need more frequent irrigation, In contrast to sandy soil, clayey soil is much less permeable, so it can retain water for a much longer time. So, when the crops grown in a clayey soil are irrigated, the water persists in the soil for a longer time and as a consequence plants grown in clayey soil can absorb this water in adequate amount. Thus, due to good water retaining capacity of the clayey soil, the crops cultivated in clayey soil need irrigation less frequently.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Cropping Techniques</h3>
	<p>Have you noticed different crops growing together in the same field? Do you know the reason for this? Farmers often grow different crops together without any definite pattern. You will also see that different crops are grown in a definite pattern i.e. in a sequence (like alternating each crop with the other etc.). These methods increase the yield. <br />
		How does growing of different crops in a definite pattern in a field increase the yield? <br />
		Three different cropping patterns, namely mixed cropping, intercropping, and crop rotation are generally practised.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Mixed Cropping</h4>
		<p>Mixed cropping allows two or more crops to be sowed simultaneously in the same land. Wheat and gram, wheat and mustard, ground nut and sunflower etc. are some common examples of mixed cropping. <br />
			In mixed cropping, crops are chosen in such a way that they require different amounts of minerals.</p>

			For example, cauliflower and chilli plants are grown together in alternating rows. To ensure  the maximum utilization of nutrients applied, crops are selected in such a way that their nutrient requirements are different. Other examples include soya bean and maize, finger miller  (bajra) and cowpea (lobia) etc.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Methods of farming cattle.</h4>
		<p>In India, two different species of cattle are widely reared, Bos indicus (cow) and Bos bubalis ( eb luff (buffalo). The purpose of cattle farming is usually for the production of milk and labour in agricultural fields.<br />
			Female dairy animals used to obtain milk are known as milch animals. The production of milk depends upon the lactation period. Male animals are engaged in agricultural fields for labour work like carting, irrigation, tilling etc. Cattle used for labour is called draught animal. <br />
			Cattle management involves maintaining proper shelter facilities and regular cleaning. Animals require a regular bath and brushing to control the spread of diseases. They should be kept under a well-ventilated roof, which will prevent them from the heat, cold, and rain.</p>

		<p>Canals, ponds, and rivers are some freshwater resources. Brackish water resources are generally found where seawater and fresh water occur together. It includes estuaries and lagoons. Fresh water fisheries and brackish water fisheries are called inland fisheries. <br />
			An intensive way of farming fishes is the composite fish culture system. In such a system, five or six different species of fishes are grown together in a single fishpond. Fishes with different food habitats are chosen, so that they do not compete for food among themselves. For example, catla feed on the surface of water,rohu are middle zone feeders, mrigal and common carp are bottom feeders, and grass carp feed on weeds. This ensures complete utilization of food resources in the pond. Such a system increases the fish yield. <br />
			A major problem with this system is that many of these fishes breed only during monsoon. However, the use of hormonal stimulations has rovided a solution for this roblem. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Do you know why fishes obtained from fisheries are more useful commercially?</span>
			<br />
			The fishes obtained from fisheries are larger as they receive proper food, and have a healthy environment for their growth. Thus, they are commercially useful. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Varieties of Bees</h4>
		<p>In India, both local and foreign breeds are used for commercial honey production. Local breeds include Apis cerana indica (Indian bee), Apis dorsata (rock bee), andApis florae (little bee). Commercially, the Italian breed Apis mellifera is used for honey production. This is because of the following reasons:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>They yield large quantities of honey</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Since they do not sting much, the collection of honey becomes easier</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>They stay in their beehives for long durations</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>They breed very well</p>
