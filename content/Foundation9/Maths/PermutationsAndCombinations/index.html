		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Multiplication Principle </h4>
		<p> If an operation can be performed in 'm' different ways; following which a second opera-tion can be performed in 'n' different ways, then the two operations in succession can be performed in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  m \times n  \) </span> different ways. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Example: </span>
			<br />
			How many numbers of two digits can be formed out of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 no digit being repeated ? <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Sol. </span>
			<br />
			The first digit can be any one of the four digits 1, 2, 3, 4, that is the first digit can be chosen in four ways. Having chosen the first digit, we are left with three digits from which the second digit can be chosen. Therefore, the possible ways of choosing the two digits are  4 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span>  3 = 12. <br />
			Since the first digit can be chosen in four ways and for each choice of the first digit there are three ways of choosing the second digit, therefore, there are 4 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span>  3 = ways, that is, </p>

			<img src="104180009_image-1.png" alt="image1" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />

		<p>12 ways of choosing both the digits. Thus, 12 numbers can be formed. </p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Addition Principle </h4>
		<p>If an operation can be performed in 'm' different ways and another operation, which is independent of the first operation, can be performed in 'n' different ways, then either of the two operations can be performed in (m + n) ways.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Note: </span> The above two principle can be extended for any finite number of operations. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Example: </span>
			<br />
			Suppose there are 5 gates to stadium, 2 on one side and 3 on the other. Mohan has to go out of the stadium. He can go out from any one of the 5 gates. <br />
			Thus, the number of ways in which he can go out is 5. Hence, the work of going out through the gates on one side will be done in 2 ways and the work of going out through the gates on other side will be done in 3 ways. <br />
			The work of going out will be done when Mohan goes out from side I or side II. Thus the work of going out can be done in (2 + 3) = 5 ways. </p>

			A telegraph has 5 arms and each arm is capable of 4 distinct positions, including the position of rest. Find the total number of signals that can be made.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Two arms may have the same position, but same arm cannot have two positions at a time.<br />
			Hence, in this problem, position is repeatable (R), but arm is non-repeatable (NR). Here, number of distinct positions = R = 4 <br />
