		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Stability of an object</h4>
		<p>Stability refers to the ability of an object to regain its original position after it has been tilted slightly. <br />
			The stability of an object can be better understood by placing a cone shaped object in different positions as shown below and tilting or displacing it slightly. <br />
			In figure , when the object is tilted slightly, its centre of gravity rises and then falls back again. This is an example of a stable equilibrium. The line of action of weight W of the object lies inside the base area of the object. The applied clockwise moment while tilting the object is counteracted by the anticlockwise moment about the point of contact P of the object with the floor in the tilted position.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104380006_image-12.png" alt="image12" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>In figure , the object is placed upside down with the smaller area in contact with the floor. If the object is tilted slightly, it will not return to its original position, but will topple. The centre of gravity falls further. As the line of action of weight W of the object likes outside the base area, the clockwise moment of W about the point of contact P, Causes the body to topple. This is an example of an unstable equilibrium. </p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104380006_image-13.png" alt="image13" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>In figure , the object is placed horizontally with its side touching the ground. If the object is rolled or displaced from the original position slightly, it will stay in the new position. The centre of gravity neither rises nor falls but stays at the same level from the ground. The line of action of the reaction R at the point of contact with the ground and the line of action of weight W always coincide. hence, no moment is provided by the weight W about the point of contact to turn the conical object. This is an example of a neutral equilibrium.</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="104380006_image-14.png" alt="image14" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		<p>The two important factors to increase the stability of an object are:</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>The centre of gravity should be as low as possible.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The area of the base should be as wide as possible.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>These factors will ensure that the vertical line passing through the centre of gravity of a body will always lie inside the base of the body when it is tilted or inclined. <br />

		<p>A uniform metre ruler is pivoted at its mid point. A weight of 80 gf is suspended at one end of it. Where should a weight of 160 gf be suspended, to keep the rule horizontal?</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution:</span>
			<br />
			Let AB be the uniform metre ruler, such that C is its midpoint. The metre ruler is pivoted at C, such that AC = 50 cm and CB = 50 cm. 80 gf weight is suspended near A.  <br />
			Let D be the point of suspension of 100 gf weight at a distance of x from C, so that the ruler is horizontal. <br />
			Left hand side moment, <br />
			LHM = 80<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> 80 = 6400 gf cm  ...... (1) <br />
			right hand side moment, <br />
			RHM = x <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \times  \) </span> 160 = 160x gf cm .....(2) <br />
			To keep the ruler horizontal, <br />
			LHM = RHM <br />
			6400 = 160x <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Rightarrow  \) </span> x = 40 cm <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore  \) </span>160 gf is to be suspended at a distance of 40 cm from middle point (or) 60 cm from the end of the ruler.</p>
