	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Natural occurring substances which have the property of attracting pieces of iron, cobalt, nickel etc., are called natural magnets. Lodestone is a natural magnet. On rubbing a piece of iron with lode stone, the piece of iron acquires magnetic properties and behaves as a magnet. These type of magnets are known as artificial magnets. There are several other ways of producing artificial magnets.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Attracive property</h4>
		<p>Magnets attract small pieces of iron seems to be very high in small regions of the magnet. These regions are called magnetic poles.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Directive property</h4>
		<p>A freely suspended magnet always aligns itself in the north-south direction. This property of magnet is known as directive property.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Law of magnetic poles</h4>
		<p>Like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each other. <br/>
			Since a magnet can attract small pieces of iron or the south pole of another magnet, the attractive property is not a sure test to find out whether the given piece is a magnet or not. Repulsion is a sure test to confirm whether the given piece is a magnet.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Pair property</h4>
		<p>When we break a magnet each of the pieces will have a North and a South pole at the ends. If we break it further we find that both the pieces formed will have the south and the north poles at its ends. The above phenomenon is observed till we reach a molecular stage. Magnetic poles always exist in pairs and single poles do not exist.</p>

<section class="skill" id="03">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Magnetic Induction</h3>
	<p>Magnetic materials like steel acquire the attractive property, when placed near a magnet. The phenomenon due to which magnetism is produced in a magnetic substance by the mere presence of a magnet near it is called magnetic induction. <br/>
		The poles formed in the substance in which magnetism is induced are called induction poles. <br/>
		When we bring a magnet near a magnetic substance like a steel rod, the nearer end of the magnetic substance attains an opposite polarity, hence the steel rod gets attracted towards the magnet. Thus, magnetic induction preceedes attraction. <br/>
		This implies that soft iron is used for making temporary magnets as it loses magnetism easily whereas in case of steel the induced magnetism is not lost easily and is retained for a long time making it useful for preparation of permanent magnets. Hence, the degree of magnetisation in case of steel is less than that of soft iron.</p>
