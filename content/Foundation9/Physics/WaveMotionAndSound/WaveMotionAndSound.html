	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>In our daily life, we observe certain motions that repeat in a fixed interval of time. These motions are termed as periodic motion. A few of them are a vibrating spring, motion of a diving board, motion of hands of a clock, motion of earth around the sun etc., In these periodic motions some bodies move to and fro or back and forth which are called oscillatory motion. The oscillations produced by the vibrations or oscillations of a wave results in formation of waves. A wave is one way of transferring the energy without any matter.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading"> Sound</h3>
	<p>Sound is a form of energy which is emitted by a vibrating body. It travels in the form of waves and causes the sensation of hearing. Sound wave are mechanical in nature and hence cannot travel through vacuum. For example - vibrations in a stretched rubber band produces sound, plucking the wire of sitar produces sound.</p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Speed of Sound in Solids, Liquids Lnd Gases</h4>
		<p>Sound travels with different speeds in different media. The speed of sound in solids is maximum, less in liquids and the least in air or gases i.e., <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V_{solid} &gt; V_{liquid} &gt; V_{gas}  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Velocity of Sound in Solids</h5>
		<p>When a longitudinal wave passes through a solid (thin rod), the elasticity concerned is the young's modulus. The velocity (V) of sound is given by <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v = \sqrt{ \frac{Y}{d}}  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Velocity of Sound in Gase</h5>
		<p>The expression for finding velocity of sound. in gases was formulated by Newton. He assumed that when sound waves travel in a gas; the condensations and rarefactions take place in the gas under isothermal conditions, thereby no appreciable changes in temperature is noticed. Accordingly Newton gave the formula for velocity of sound in a gas as<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v = \sqrt{ \frac{E}{d}}  \) </span>
			<br />
			a Where, E is the isothermal bulk modulus and 'd' is the density of the gas. The theoretical value of velocity of sound using Newton's formula is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  280 \ m \ s^{-1}  \) </span>. But the experimental value obtained from various experiments is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  331 \ m \ s^{-1}  \) </span>. Later on this was explained by Laplace. According to Laplace, when sound waves travel through air, there are compressions and rarefactions in the particles of the medium. Whenever there is a compression, particles come near to each other and are heated up. If there is a rarefaction, the particles move apart and there is fall in temperature. Therefore, the temperature does not remain constant during the propagation of sound and the process is not isothermal but adiabatic. From an adiabatic process PV' = Constant, where <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \gamma  \) </span> is the ratio of specific heats of the gas and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  E = \gamma P  \) </span> .

	<h3 class="skill-heading"> Factors Affecting Velocity of Sound in a Gas</h3> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Effect of temperature on the velocity of sound</h4>
		<p>The velocity of sound in a gas is directly proportional to the square root of absolute temperature. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore \ V \propto \sqrt{T}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Therefore, as the temperature of a gas increases, the velocity of sound in it also increases. <br />
			If <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V_0  \) </span> is the velocity of sound in air at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0 ^{\circ}C  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   V_t  \) </span>is the velocity at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  t ^{\circ}C  \) </span>, then <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V_1 = V_0 \left ( 1 + \frac{t}{546} \right )  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Pressure</h5>
		<p>For a perfect gas, the general equation of a gas is <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  Pv = nRT \ \Rightarrow \ P = \left ( \frac{nM}{v} \right ) \frac{RT}{M}  \\\\[3pt]
				\Rightarrow \ P = \rho \left ( \frac{RT}{M} \right ) \ or \ \frac{P}{\rho} = \frac{RT}{M}  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			If temperature of a gas is kept constant then the ratio <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{P}{\rho}  \) </span> remains constant. So velocityP of sound in a gas is independent of pressure as long as temperature remains constant. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Density</h5>
		<p>Assuming all other conditions are kept constant for different gases, the velocity of sound is inversely proportional to square root of the density of a gas. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V = \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Under similar conditions of pressure and temperature the ratio of speed of sound in anytwo gases of same atomicity will be <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{V_1}{V_2} = \sqrt{\frac{M_1}{M_2}}  \) </span> where <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  M_1, \ M_2  \) </span>  denote molecular masses of the two gases.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Nature of gas</h5>
		<p>
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V \ \propto \sqrt{\lambda}  \) </span> when pressure, density and temperature of a gas are kept constant. The value of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \lambda  \) </span> depends on atomicity of gases.</p>

		<p>Pitch is the effect produced in the   ear due to the sound of some particular   frequency. Pitch depends upon the frequency of a vibrating body i.e., the higher the pitch, the more is the frequency and the lower the pitch the less is the frequency. The voice of women is more shrill than the voice of a man. The shrill sound is called high pitch sound, where as a soft or less shrill sounds is called low pitch sound.</p>

	<p>The human ear as shown in the figure here is divided into three parts - the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The pinna of the outer ear helps in diverting these compression rarefactions to the eardrum through the ear canal or auditory canal which too is a part of the outer ear. The eardrum, also known as tympanic membrane forms the gateway to the middle ear. It is lightly stretched membrane of about <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0.8 \times 10^4  \) </span> thick. <br />
		The thin and delicate ear drum has another delicate bone attached to it, which is th.e first of the three bones constituting the middle ear. The first, called the hammer, is contact with the eardrum at one end and the anvil, the second bone at the other end.<br />
		The compressions and rarefactions of the external sound make the ear drum to vibrate and these vibrations are conveyed through anvil to the third bone called the ste which is in contact with the oval window leading to the inner ear. The muddle ear is connected to the throat through the eustachian tube for equalising the presses on either side of the eardrum.<br />
		The inner ear consists of the spiral shaped cochlea containing a fluid. The minute vibrations of the oval window coming from the outer and middle ears agitate this fluid causing the hair-like projections on a membrane in the cochlea to vibrate. The resonant vibrations of the hair-like structures generate signals in the auditory nerve connected to the brain to be interpreted as sounds with corresponding frequencies.</p>
