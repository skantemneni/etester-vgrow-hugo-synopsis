	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Heat, a form of energy, which causes a sensation of hotness or coldness. It is also called as a life sustaining energy, that produces a number of effects in material as well as living bodies. The main effects of heat are causing change in temperature, in dimensions, in state and in chemical change.</p>
</section> 
<section class="skill" id="02">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Heat and temperature</h3>
	<p>Heat, when supplied to any body, generally causes change in the temperature of body. Thus, temperature is a physical quantity that measures the degree of hotness or coldness.</p>
</section> 
<section class="skill" id="03">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Thermal equilibrium</h3>
	<p>When two bodies at different temperatures are brought in contact with each other, heat energy flows from a body at higher temperature to a body at lower temperature. The net flow of heat energy ceases, when the temperatures of the two bodies become equal. At this stage the two bodies are said to be in thermal equilibrium with each other. Thus, the two bodies are said to be in the state of thermal equilibrium, when net exchange of heat energy between them is nil. In the state of thermal equilibrium, the two bodies have equal temperatures.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Measurement of temperature</h4>
		<p>Galileo was first to construct a thermometer named of by him as thermoscope. This works on the principle of property expansion of gases on heating. Therefore any property of a Particular matter (i.e. either a soild or a liquid or a gas) that changes linearly with temperature can be used in the construct of thermometers. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Liquid thermometers</h4>
		<p>A thermometer that uses the property of expansion of liquids are called liquid thermometer. The liquid used is called thermometric liquid. The choice of this liquid to be used depends on the range of temperatures to be measured. <br />
			Generally, mercury and alcohol are used as thermometric lquids. Both these liquids are chosen because of their following properties.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Thermometric scales</h3>
	<p>There are mainly three kinds of thermometric scales of temperatur. </p> 
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Celsius scale</h4>
		<p>It is introduced by Celsius. On this scale the melting point of ice and boiling water are calibrated as lower and upper fixed points. On this scale the lower fixed point is equal to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0^{\circ} C  \) </span> while upper fixed point is equal to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  100^{\circ} C  \) </span>.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Fahrenheit scale</h4>
		<p>This scale was introduced by Fahrenheit. This scale is also defined having its lower and upper fixed points at freezing point of water (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  32^{\circ} F  \) </span>) and at the boiling point of water (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  212^{\circ} F  \) </span>) with 180 equal divisions.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Kelvin or absolute scale</h4>
		<p>This scale is known as absolute scale of temperature because when a body loses heat, the average kinetic energy of the molecules decreases and at a certain stage the average kinetic energy of molecules becomes zero. A temperature below this is not possible which is the lowest temperature that is attainable which is equal to absolute zero or zero kelvin. <br />
			Mathematical calculation show that, 0 K =  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  - 273^{\circ} C  \) </span>
		</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Relation between the three scales</h4>
		<p>The relation of a given temperature of a substance in different scales is found by equating the ratio of measured length of mercury column to that of total length of mercury column between the respective lower and upper fixed points of each scale as it is always constant for any temperature scale. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \therefore \ \frac{C - 0}{100 - 0} = \frac{F - 32}{212 - 32}  \\\\[3pt]

		</p>
	</section> 
</section> 
<section class="skill" id="05">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">	Clinical Thermometer</h3>
	<p>A clinical thermometer is used for measuring the h an body temperature. It is calibrated from <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  95^{\circ} F  \) </span> to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  110^{\circ} F  \) </span>. A clinical thermometer is also a mercury thermometer. To measure the body temperature bulb of the clinical thermometer is placed in the mouth of a patient for sometime. The heat given by the body of the patient causes the mercury contained in thermometer to raise. The correct body temperature of a patient can be measured even after removing the thermometer from his mouth by providing a constriction near its bulb. It helps to break the mercury thread such that it does not flow back to the bulb immediately. Clinical thermometer is sterilized using formaldehyde.</p>

		<p>A bimetallic consists of strips of brass and iron of the same length, either welded or riveted together so that on heating they do not slip sideways. On heating, the strip bends in such a way that brass is on the outside and iron is on the inside. This is because brass expands by greater amount when heated through the same rise of temperature. On cooling, the bimetallic strip bends in such a way that brass is on the inner side and iron on the outside. This is because brass contracts by a greater amount and its length decreases by a larger amount than the iron strip for the same range of temperature.</p>
