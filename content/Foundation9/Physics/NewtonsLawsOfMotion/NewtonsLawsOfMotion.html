	<h3 class="skill-heading">Newton's laws of motion</h3>
	<p>It is our common observation that an object such as a chair lying in a room or a vehicle parked outside the house remains at rest unless a push or a pull is given to it. Such an object cannot move on its own. In other words, force has to be applied in order to move an object at rest. Also, if an object is moving along a straight line with some velocity, it is found that the force is required to change its direction of motion or the magnitude of the velocity. In other words, force is an agent, which causes acceleration. However, in certain cases, the acceleration caused by the force may be practically zero.<br />
		Hence, force is a push or a pull which produces or tends to produce motion in a body at rest; stops or tends to stop a body which is in motion, increases or decreases the magnitude of velocity of the moving body or changes the direction of motion of the moving body.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Galileo's Experiment</h3>
	<p>Galileo was the first to demonstrate the relationship between motion and force. He released a ball from rest on one of the inclined plane, the ball rolled down the inclined plane, similarly if the ball is made to move upwards it travelled upwards to attain certain height. From the above illustration he concluded that </p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>a body when rolled down an inclined plane, the velocity of the body increases while the velocity of the body decreases when the body rolls up the plane.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>if inclination of anyone of the plane varies, the ball will attain different heights.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>If a double inclined plane is used with different. It can be observed that as the slope of an inclined plane is changed, body reaches same height travelling longer distance. In the limiting case, if the slope of a plane is made zero, the ball travels an infinite distance. Hence based on the above facts it can be summarised that, if the external force is zero, a body at rest continues to be at rest and a body in motion continues to moves with uniform velocity. These ideas suggested by Galileo were later formulated into a law by newton as Newtons first law of motion.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="03">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Newton's First Law of Motion</h3>
	<p>A particle remains at rest or moves in a straight line with a constant speed unless it is compelled to change that state by an external unbalanced force. First law of motion gives the definition of inertia.</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="04">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Inertia</h3>
	<p>We see that a body does not change its state of rest or uniform motion. If it is at rest, it continues to be at rest. If it is moving, it continues to move with uniform velocity. A force can change its state of rest or state of uniform motion. This inability of a body to change its state of rest or uniform motion on its own is known as inertia. Since the first law is about inertia, it is also known as Galileo's law of inertia. <br />
		Inertia may be thought of as having two forms: inertia of rest, due to which a body at rest continues to be at rest, and inertia of motion, due to which a moving body retains its constant velocity.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Inertia of rest</h4>
		<p>When a bus suddenly moves, a person standing in it tends to fall backward. This is because, the lower part of his body (his feet) in contact with the bus begins to move with the bus, but the upper part of his body, due to inertia, would remain at rest. This causes the person to fall backward. <br />
			On shaking the branch of a tree, fruits in it fall down. This is because, when the branch is shaken, it is set into motion, while the fruits remain in the state of rest due to the inertia of rest. Thus, the fruits are detached from the branch and fall down. <br />
			Tendency of a body to continue in its state of rest.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			When a bus starts suddenly, the passengers fall backwards. This is due to inertia of rest.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Inertia of motion</h4>
		<p>When a person jumps out of a moving bus and tries to walk on the ground, he falls forward. This is because, inside the bus, his complete body was in the state of motion with the bus. On jumping out, as soon as his feet touch the ground, the lower part of his body comes to rest while the upper part remains in motion due to inertia of motion. This makes him fall along the direction of motion of the bus.<br />
			Tendency of a body to continue in its state of motion.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Example</span>
			<br />
			A bicycle is observed to move forward even when pedaling is stopped, this is due to inertia of motion.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Inertia of direction</h4>
		<p>Tendency of a body to continue to move with uniform motion in a linear direction.<br />
			To change the state of rest or of uniform motion of a body an external unbalanced force is needed. This force depends on the inertia which in turn depends on the mass of the body. Hence, mass is the measure of inertia of a body.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Linear Momentum (p)</h3>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Newton's Second Law of Motion</h3>
	<p> The rate of change of momentum of a particle is directly proportional to the force acting on it and takes place in the direction of applied force.<br />

		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \overrightarrow{F} \propto \frac{ \Delta P}{ \Delta \overset{ \rightarrow}t}  \\\\[3pt]

		The value of constant of proportionality can be taken as 1 when unit of force is chosen in such a way that it produces unit acceleration by a unit mass then F = ma.</p>

			Let a gun and a bullet in its barrel constitute a system. Initially both are at rest. When the bullet is fired, it moves forward and gun recoils.

		<p>Calculate the force acting on the ball, if mass of the ball is 200 g.</p>

			<br />
			The graph shows that the velocity of the ball at t = 0 is 0.<br />

			From the graph, final velocity of the ball after 4 seconds = v = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  20 m s^{-1}  \) </span>

			Mass of the ball = m = 200 g = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{200}{1000} kg = \frac{1}{5} kg  \) </span>
			<br />
			Force acting on the ball = F = ? <br />
			We know that, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F = ma = m \left( \frac{v - u}{t} \right) ........(1) \ \ \ \  \left[ \therefore a = \frac{v - u}{t} \right] \) </span>
			<br />
			Substituting the above values in (1), we have <br />
			Force acting on the ball <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = F = ma = \frac{1}{5} \left( \frac{20 - 0}{4} \right) = \frac{1}{5} \times 5 = 1 N  \) </span>
