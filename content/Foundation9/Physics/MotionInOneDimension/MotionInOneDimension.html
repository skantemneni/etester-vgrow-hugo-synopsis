	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>In our daily life, we observe a mosquito flying, the cars moving on a road, the motion of the blades of a fan, the motion of our hand etc., In these examples, we observe that the motion of these objects can be either in one dimension or more than one dimension. <br />
		In general, the study of the bodies under motion in a straight line can be in one dimension.<br />
		One dimensional motion refers to motion of a body in either horizontal or in vertical direction is learnt under the topic motion in one dimension.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Rest</h3>
	<p> The two most basic concepts in physics (and in science) are space and time. We live in space to experience time. What is space? What is time? These are very difficult questions to answer. It suffices our purpose to assume that space is where all physical objects stay and interact. Time is our way of describing how these objects change. It is interesting to note that neither space nor time can be measured directly; it is the interval in space or time that can be measured. Therefore, metre and second represent length (interval in space) and duration (interval in time) respectively. <br />
		A body is said to be at rest if it does not change its position with respect to the surroundings and time. For example a book on the table, a house, a tree etc.,</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="03">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Motion</h3>
	<p>A body is said to be in motion if it changes its position with respect to the surroundings and time. For example a moving car water flowing in a river. <br />
		Rest and motion are relative. For example a man on the earth is at rest with respect to the earth. But he is in motion with respect to Sun.</p>

	<p>A body under motion can exhibit mainly three types of motion. </p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Translatory motion </h4>
		<p> A body moving in a straight line is said to undergo translatory motion. A translatory motion may be a straight line (rectilinear) motion or a curvilinear motion.<br />

					<p> The uniform velocity of the lift does not change the relative motion of ball and lift <br />

						<br />
						Using v = u + at, 0 = 49 - 9.8 t or 9.8 t = 49 or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  t = \frac{49}{9.8} s = 5s  \) </span>

			<br />
			Since graph is a straight line, therefore it means that displacement is proportional to time. <br />
			In other words, body is covering equal distances in equal intervals of time in specified direction, and hence, is moving with a uniform velocity.<br />
			The slope of this graph gives uniform velocity.<br />
			Thus, velocity of body <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = \frac{ \overrightarrow{ \Delta} x}{ \Delta t} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{10 m}{2 s} = 5 \ ms^{-1}  \) </span>
