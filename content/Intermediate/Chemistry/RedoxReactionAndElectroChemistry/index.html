		<p> The reaction which involves oxidation and reduction as its two half-reactions is called <span class="highlight01">  redox reaction </span>. Normally it is found that oxidation and reductions reaction are complementary to each other and occur simultaneously. Their simultaneous occurrence is seen in the form of redox reaction. </p>

The reverse of such a process can be defined as <span class="highlight01"> reduction </span>. Both the above written terms can be defined in many ways as :</p>

					<span class="highlight01"> Ion-electron method </span> The ion-electron method for balancing redox reactions was given by <span class="highlight01"> Jette </span> and <span class="highlight01"> Lamev </span> in 1927. The method involves following steps: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p> Write the redox reaction in ionic form.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Split the redox reaction into its two half-reactions, ie, the oxidation half and the reduction-half. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Balance atoms of each half-reaction by using simple multiples (not applidable for hydrogen and oxygen )</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> For balancing H and O :</p>  
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>Use simple multiples if possible.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<span class="highlight01"> For acidic and	neutral solutions </span>  add water molecules to the side deficient in oxygen and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H^{+}  \) </span> to the side deficient in hydrogen. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<span class="highlight01"> In case of for alkaline solution </span>  for each excess of oxygen add one water molecule to the same side and two <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  OH^{-}  \) </span> ions on the other side. If hydrogen is still unbalanced add one <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  OH^{-}  \) </span> ion for each excess hydrogen on the same side and one water molecule to the other side.</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Add electrons to the side deficient in electrons, so as to equalise the charge on both the sides. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Multiply one or both the half-reactions by a suitable number so that the numbers of electrons become equal in both the equations. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Add the two balance half-reactions and cancel any term common to both the sides. <br />
					eg, in the reaction, <br />
							<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Cu + HNO_3 \rightarrow Cu(NO_3)_2 + NO + H_2O  \) </span>
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> Oxidation number method </span> This method is based upo3r-the fact that total increase in oxidation number must be equal to total decrease in oxidation number. The stepwise approach is </p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Write the skeleton equation (if not given) representing the chemical change </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Assign oxidation number to the atoms in the equation and find out which atoms are undergoing oxidation and reduction. Write separate equations for the atoms undergoing oxidation and reduction.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Find the change in oxidation number in each equation. Make the change equal in both the equations by multiplying with suitable integers. Add both the equations </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Complete the balancing. First balance those substance which undergone change in oxidation number and then other atoms except H and O. Lastly balance H and O by putting <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O  \) </span> molecules whenever needed. <br />
					eg, balance the equation, <br />
							<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Cu + HNO_3 \rightarrow Cu(NO_3)_2 + NO_2 + H_2O  \) </span>

				<p>Redox reactions form an important class of reactions in which <span class="highlight01"> oxidation </span> and <span class="highlight01"> reduction </span> occur simultaneously. Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation number, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Oxidation, reduction, oxidising agent <span class="highlight01"> (oxidant) </span>  and reducing agent <span class="highlight01"> (reductant) </span> have been viewed according to each conceptualisation. <span class="highlight01"> Oxidation numbers </span> are assigned in accordance with a consistent set of rules. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in writing equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories: combination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions.</p>

				<p>The concept of <span class="highlight01"> redox couple </span>  and <span class="highlight01"> electrode processes </span> is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide applications in the study of electrode processes and cells. </p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 1:</h4>
		<p>Justify that the reaction : <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2 Na(s) + H_2 (g) \rightarrow 2 NaH(s)  \) </span> is a redox change. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>
			<br />
		Since in the above reaction the compound formed is an ionic compound, which may also be represented as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Na^{+}H^{-} (s)  \) </span> , this suggests that one half reaction in this process is :	<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   2 Na (s) \rightarrow \ 2 Na^+(g) + 2e^{-}  \) </span>
			<br />
			and the other half reaction is: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2 (g) + 2e^{-} \rightarrow \ 2 H^{-}(g)  \) </span>
			<br /> This splitting of the reaction under examination into two half reactions automatically reveals that here sodium is oxidised and hydrogen is reduced, therefore, the complete reaction is a redox change.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 2:</h4>
		<p>Using Stock notation, represent the following compounds :<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   HAuCl_4, \ Tl_2O, \ FeO, \ Fe_2O_3, \ CuI, \  CuO, \ MnO \ and \ MnO_2  \) </span> .<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>
			<br />
		By applying various rules of calculating the oxidation number of the desired element in a compound, the oxidation number of each metallic element in its <br />
		compound is as follows:
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  HAuCl_4 \rightarrow  Au \  has \ 3  \\\\[3pt]
		Tl_2O \rightarrow T_l \ has \ 1  \\\\[3pt]
		FeO \rightarrow Fe \ has \ 2  \\\\[3pt]
		Fe_2O_3 \rightarrow Fe \ has \ 3  \\\\[3pt]
		CuI \rightarrow \ Cu \ has \ 1  \\\\[3pt]
		CuO \rightarrow Cu \ has \ 2  \\\\[3pt]
		MnO \rightarrow Mn \ has \ 2  \\\\[3pt]
		MnO_2 \rightarrow Mn \ has \ 4  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
		Therefore, these compounds may be represented as: <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  HAu(III)Cl_4, \ Tl_2(I)O, \ Fe(II)O, \ Fe_2(III)O_3, \ Cu(I)I, \ Cu(II)O, \ Mn(II)O, \ Mn(IV)O_2  \) </span>. </p>

		<p>Which of the following species, do not show disproportionation reaction and why?<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ClO^{-}, \ Cl{O_2}^{-}, \ Cl{O_3)^{-} \ and \ Cl{O_4}^{-}  \) </span>

		 Also write reaction for each of the species that disproportionates. <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>

		Among the oxoanions of chlorine listed above, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Cl{O_4}^{-}  \) </span> does not disproportionate because in this oxoanion chlorine is present in its highest oxidation state that is, +7.
