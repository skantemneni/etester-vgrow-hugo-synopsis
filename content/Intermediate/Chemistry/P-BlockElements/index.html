		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Carbon </h4>
		<p> It is one of the most widely distributed element. It occurs naturally in pure forms like diamond and graphite and more abundantly as coal. But coal is not as pure as diamond and graphite. All the naturally occurring forms are recovered as such from their respective mines. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Method of preparation </span> Graphite and diamond can be prepared artificially also. <br />

The molten mass of graphite crucible is then cooled rapidly by placing it in a bath of molten lead (temperature <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( 327^{\circ}C  \) </span>). As a result of solidification of external surface of iron, an enormous pressure is exerted on the interior mass (cast iron is expanded on solidification). Under these conditions, the carbon is thrown in the form of minute diamonds. </p>
