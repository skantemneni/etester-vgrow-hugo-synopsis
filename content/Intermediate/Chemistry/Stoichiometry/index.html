	<p>Lavoisier established the <span class="highlight01"> "law of conservation of mass" </span> according to which the matter can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Lavoisier's law of conservation of mass helped in establishing <span class="highlight01">the law of constant composition or the law of definite proportions </span> (given by J. Proust) which states, "A sample of a pure compound always consists of the same elements combined in same proportions by mass, whatever be its source. eg, ammonia always has the formula <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NH_3  \) </span> ie, one molecule of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NH_3  \) </span> always contains one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen or 17.0 g of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NH_3  \) </span> always contains 14 g of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  N_2  \) </span> and g of hydrogen. These findings always remain the same for <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NH_3.  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>John Dalton observed that an element may form more than one compound with another element. He note that for a given mass of an element, the masses of other elements (in 2 or more compounds) come in the ratio of small integers. This is called <span class="highlight01"> "law of multiple proportions". </span> eg, in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NH_3,  \) </span> 14 g of nitrogen requires 3 g of hydrogen and in hydrazine <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (N_2H_4)  \) </span> 14 g of nitrogen requires 2 g of hydrogen. Hence, fixed mass of nitrogen requires hydrogen in the ratio 3 : 2 in two different compounds (3 : 2 is a simple ratio). Thus, this is in agreement with "law of multiple proportions".</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>"The volume of reactants and products in a large number of chemical reactions are related to each other by small integers, provided the volumes are measured at same temperature and pressure". These lines are considered as <span class="highlight01">"the law of definite proportions by volume" </span> given by Gay-Lussac, a French chemist. eg, in the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to produce water it was found that 2 vol of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2  \) </span> combines with 1 vol of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  O_2  \) </span> to form 2 vol of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O  \) </span> (steam). This simply means that 100 mL of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( H_2  \) </span> gas combines with 50 mL of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  O_2  \) </span> to produce exactly 100 mL of steam (if all the gases are measured at same temperature and pressure).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>"The volume of a gas (at constant pressure and temperature) is proportional to the number of moles (or molecules) of gas present". This is called Avogadro's law. Hence, according to this law :<br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V \propto n  \) </span>
					<br />
					where, n = number of moles of gas.

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Mole Concept</h3>
	<p>The word 'mole' was introduced around 1896 by W. Ostwald who derived it from Latin word 'moles' means a 'heap' or 'pile'. In 1967 this word was accepted as a unit of chemical substances under SI system. It is represented by the symbol 'mol'.<br />
		One mole of any substance is defined as :</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">

				<p>The amount which weighs exactly same as its formula weight in gram or atomic mass in gram or molecular mass in gram.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Stoichiometry</h3>
	<p>The methods used to describe the atomic and molecular masses constitute the generalised approach to chemical calculations and quantitative methods called <span class="highlight01"> chemical stoichiometry. </span> (Stoichiometry from Greek words stoichion = element; metron = measure). Solving of stoichiometric problems require a firm grasp of mole concept, balancing chemical equations and care in consistent use of units.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Limiting Reactant or Limiting Reagent </h4>
		<p>If a reaction involves two or more reactants, the reactant that is consumed first is called <span class="highlight01">limiting reagent or limiting reactant </span> as it limits the amount of product formed. eg, If 2 moles each of hydrogen and oxygen is ignited, the limiting reactant is hydrogen. This is found as :</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>First we write the balance equation of formation of water.<br />

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>From the equation, it is clear that for 1 mole of hydrogen half mole oxygen is required. Hence, for 2 mol hydrogen, oxygen required =1 mol. Thus, for this process, oxygen is in excess and hydrogen is limited, so hydrogen is the limiting reagent.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Balancing of Chemical Equations</h3>
	<p>A balanced chemical equation gives a lot of quantitative information about a chemical reaction. It provides the quantitative relationship between the masses of reactants and the products, ie, the quantity of substance consumed and produced can be determined by it only.<br />
		Hence, here first of all we are describing the steps of simplest and generalised method of balancing the equation, ie, <span class="highlight01">the trial and error method.</span>
		<br />
		For the reaction:<br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( C_3H_8(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 3CO_2(g) + H+2O(l)  \) </span>

			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( C_3H_8 + O_2 \rightarrow 3CO_2 + H_2O  \) </span>
		</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Step 2 Balance the number of hydrogen atoms :</h4>
		<p>As 8 hydrogen atoms are present in reactants and one molecule of water contains 2H atoms in it, hence the product side should contain <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( 4H_2O  \) </span> molecules, ie,<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( C_3H_8 + O_2 \rightarrow 3CO_2 + H_2O  \) </span>
		</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Step 3 Balance the number of oxygen atoms :</h4>
		<p>As 10 oxygen atoms are present on the product side and reactant side have only 2 oxygen atoms, hence the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  O_2  \) </span> molecule on the reactant side should be multiplied by 5 ie,<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( C_3H_8 + 5O_2 \rightarrow 3CO_2 + 4H_2O  \) </span>
		</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Step 4 Verify that the number of atoms of each element is balanced in the final equation.</h4>

					<p>The above trial and error method is also called POAC (principle of atomic conservation) method.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Another method for balancing the equation is called equivalent (or milliequivalent) method. This method is based on the fact that for the different amounts of reactants and products involved in a reaction, the number of equivalents or milliequivalents are equal for each reactant and each product.<br />
						eg, for the reaction <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  VO + Fe_2O_3 \rightarrow FeO + V_2O_5  \\\\[3pt]
							Equivalent \ or \ meq. \ of \ VO \ = \ equivalent \ or \ meq. \ of \ Fe_2O_3 \ = \ equivalent \ or \ meq. \ of \ FeO \ =  \ equivalent \ or \ men. \ of \ V_2O_5.  \end{align}  \) </span>
