	<h3 class="skill-heading"> Pollutions </h3>
	<p> The contamination of environment (ie, air, water and soil) with any undesirable substance, obtained from either a natural source or human activity, which has adverse effect on plants, animals and human beings, is called environmental pollution. The biotic and abiotic components that are affected adversely, are known as receptors or targets. On the basis of the part of environment (ie, air, water, soil) affected, pollution may be of following three types : </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Atmospheric pollution </h4>
		<p> Atmospheric pollution is defined as "the presence of addition of some undesirable substances, which have adverse effect on plants and animals including human being, into the atmosphere either due to some natural phenomenon or due to human activity." Although atmosphere comprises several regions, atmospheric pollution is related to only tropospheric pollution (pollution of air) and stratospheric pollution (pollution of stratosphere, ie, depletion of ozone layer). </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Water pollution </h4>
		<p> The contamination of water by foreign substances such as solid particles, soluble salts, sewage, algae etc which make it injurious for living organisms and unfit for domestic, agricultural and industrial use is called water pollution. The pollution of water can be checked by one or more of the following parameters : taste of water, its odour, colour presence of oil or grease on its surface. These foreign substance, are termed as 'water pollutants'. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Soil pollution </h4>
		<p> Soil pollution is alteration in soil caused by addition or removal of such substances or factors that deteriorates the quality, texture and mineral content of the soil or that disturbs the biological balance of the organisms in the soil and has a lethal effect on plant growth. The substances or factors are called soil pollutants. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading"> Green chemistry and Chloro Flouro Carbons </h3>
	<p>The concept of green chemistry was introduced in 1990. It is an alternative tool for reducing pollution. Indeed, green chemistry is a branch of chemistry "in which chemicals of daily needs are produced by using such reactions or processes that neither use toxic chemicals nor emit such chemicals into the atmosphere". In this, various reactions are carried out in the presence of mild and environment friendly reagents such as ultraviolet light (photochemistry), sound waves (sonic chemistry), enzymes and microwaves so that harmful chemicals are neither used up nor released. </p>

			<li>
				<p> Environmental chemistry plays a major role in environment. Chemical species present in the environment are either naturally occurring or generated by human activities. <span class="highlight01"> Environmental pollution</span>  is the effect of undesirable changes in the surrounding that have harmful effects on plants, animals and human beings.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Pollutants exist in all the three states of matter. We have discussed only those pollutants, which are due to human activities, and can be controlled. Atmospheric pollution is generally studied as <span class="highlight01"> tropospheric</span>  and <span class="highlight01"> stratospheric pollution </span> .</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Troposphere is the lowest region of the atmosphere (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sim  \) </span> 10 km) in which man along with other organisms including plants exist. Whereas stratosphere extends above troposphere up to 50 km above sea level.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Ozone layer is one of the important constituents of stratosphere. Tropospheric pollution is basically due to various oxides of sulphur, nitrogen, carbon, halogens and also due to particulate pollutants. The gaseous pollutants come down to the earth in the form of <span class="highlight01"> acid rain </span>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>75% of the solar energy reaching earth is absorbed by the earth surface and rest is radiated back to the atmosphere. These gases mentioned above trap the heat which result into <span class="highlight01"> global warming </span> .</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>It is important to realise that these very gases are also responsible for the life on the earth as they trap the requisite amount of solar energy for the sustainance of life. The increase in the <span class="highlight01"> greenhouse gases </span> is raising the temperature of the earth's atmosphere which, if not checked, may eventually result in melting of polar ice caps and consequently may submerge the costal land mass.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Many human activities are producing chemicals, which are responsible for the <span class="highlight01"> depletion of ozone layer </span> in the stratosphere, leading to the formation of ozone hole. Through the ozone hole, ultraviolet radiations can penetrate into the earth's atmosphere causing mutation of genes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Water is the elixir of life but the same water, if polluted by pathogens, organic wastes, toxic heavy metals, pesticides etc., will turn into poison.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Therefore, one should take care to follow international standards to maintain purity levels of drinking water. Industrial wastes and excessive use of pesticides, result into pollution of land mass and water bodies. Judicious use of chemicals required for agricultural practices can lead to sustainable development. <span class="highlight01"> Strategies for controlling environmental pollution </span> can be:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p> waste management i.e., reduction of the waste and proper disposal, also recycling of materials and energy,</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>adopting methods in day-to-day life, which results in the reduction of environmental pollution. The second method is a new branch of chemistry, which is in its infancy known as <span class="highlight01"> green chemistry </span>. It utilizes the existing knowledge and practices so as to bring about reduction in the production of pollutants.</p>
