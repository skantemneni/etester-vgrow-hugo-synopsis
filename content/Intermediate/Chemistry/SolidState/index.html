		<p>A solid is defined as that form of matter which has rigidity and due to which possesses a definite volume and a definite shape. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Types of Solids</h5>
		<p> The solids can be classified into following two types </p>

				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Amorphous solids : </span> The solids which do not have any definite shape geometrically are called <span class="highlight01"> amorphous </span> (Morpha = form) solids. Infact these have a random and disordered arrangement of atoms. These solids are also called "supercooled liquids" and are without sharp melting points ie, these have <span class="highlight01"> "short range order" </span> of their constituent atoms like that in the liquids. eg, glass, rubber, plastics, etc. </p>
				</li>

		<p> The crystals are bounded by surfaces which are usually planar and arranged in definite pattern. These surfaces are called 'faces'. Faces are of two types namely like and unlike faces. The crystals with all similar surfaces is said to have like faces, eg, alums, fluorspar, etc, while galena crystal has unlike faces, ie, it has a combination of cubical and octahedral faces. <br />
			All the faces corresponding to a crystal are said to constitute a form. The forms may be <span class="highlight01"> simple </span> (with like faces) or in combination (with unlike faces). In a crystal, when two adjacent faces intersect, we get an <span class="highlight01"> edge </span> and when three or more edges intersect, we get a <span class="highlight01"> solid angle </span> . The angle between the normals to the two intersecting faces is ca, interfacial angle ie, </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Bragg's Law(Determination of crystal structure by X-ray diffraction)</h4>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Packing of Particles in a Crystal</h4>
		<p>To understand the packing of particles in a crystal, it is assumed that these particles are hard spheres of identical size. The number of spheres surrounding a particular sphere is called the <span class="highlight01"> co-ordination number </span> of that sphere ie. in simple words coordination number is the number of atoms or ions or molecules surrounding a particular atom in a crystal lattice. The packing can be seen in one of the following ways : </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Close Packing in One Dimension</h5>
		<p>The simplest way is if spheres are placed in a horizontal row touching each other as seen below: </p>
		<div class="synopsis-image">

		<p> As among two dimensional packings hexagonal close packings are more efficients, the three dimensional packings are upon this hexagonal close packing patterns. In two dimensional packings, the voids are also two dimensional similarly in three dimensional packings the voids are three dimensional.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Summary</h3>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Solids have definite mass, volume and shape. This is due to the fixed position of their constituent particles, short distances and strong interactions between them. In amorphous solids, the arrangement of constituent particles has only short range order and consequently they behave like super cooled liquids, do not have sharp melting points and are isotropic in nature. In crystalline solids there is long range order in the arrangement of their constituent particles. They have sharp melting points, are anisotropic in nature and their particles have characteristic shapes. Properties of crystalline solids depend upon the nature of interactions between their constituent particles. On this basis, they can be divided into four categories, namely: molecular, ionic, metallic and covalent solids. They differ widely in their properties.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The constituent particles in crystalline solids are arranged in a regular pattern which extends throughout the crystal. This arrangement is often depicted in the form of a three dimensional array of points which is called crystal lattice. Each lattice point gives the location of one particle in space. In all, fourteen different types of lattices are possible which are called Bravais lattices. Each lattice can be generated by repeating its small characteristic portion called unit cell.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> A unit cell is characterised by its edge lengths and three angles between these edges. Unit cells can be either primitive which have particles only at their corner positions or centred. The centred unit cells have additional particles at their body centre (bodycentred), at the centre of each face (face-centred) or at the centre of two opposite faces (end-centred).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> There are seven types of primitive unit cells. Taking centred unit cells also into account, there are fourteen types of unit cells in all, which result in fourteen <span class="highlight01">Bravais lattices </span>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Close-packing of particles result in two highly efficient lattices, hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and cubic close-packed (ccp). The latter is also called facecentred cubic (fcc) lattice. In both of these packings 74% space is filled. The remaining space is present in the form of two types of voids-octahedral voids and tetrahedral voids. Other types of packing are not close-packings and have less efficient packing of particles. While in body-centred cubic lattice (bcc) 68% space is filled, in simple cubic lattice only 52.4 % space is filled.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Solids are not perfect in structure. There are different types of imperfections or defects in them. Point defects and line defects are common types of defects. Point defects are of three types-stoichiometric defects, impurity defects and non-stoichiometric defects. Vacancy defects and interstitial defects are the two basic types of stoichiometric point defects.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In ionic solids, these defects are present as Frenkel and Schottky defects. Impurity defects are caused by the presence of an impurity in the crystal. In ionic solids, when the ionic impurity has a different valence than the main compound, some vacancies are created. Nonstoichiometric defects are of metal excess type and metal deficient type.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Sometimes calculated amounts of impurities are introduced by doping in semiconductors that change their electrical properties. Such materials are widely used in electronics industry.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Solids show many types of magnetic properties like paramagnetism, diamagnetism, ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism. These properties are used in audio, video and other recording devices.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>All these properties can be correlated with their electronic configurations or structures.</p>

			The ccp lattice is formed by the element Y. The number of octahedral voids generated would be equal to the number of atoms of Y present in it. Since all the octahedral voids are occupied by the atoms of X, their number would also be equal to that of the element Y. Thus, the atoms of elements X and Y are present in equal numbers or 1:1 ratio. Therefore, the formula of the compound is XY.</p>
