		<p> Aliphatic Amines are alkyl derivatives of ammonia in which one or more hydrogen atoms of ammonia have been replaced by alkyl groups. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Classification of Amines </h4>
		<p> Depending upon the number of alkyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom the aliphatic amines are classified as primary <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (1^{\circ}),  \) </span> secondary <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (2^{\circ})  \) </span> and tertiary <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (3^{\circ})  \) </span> amines. If number of H-atoms attached to the N atoms, is n, the degree of amines is obtained by the following formula : <br />
			Degree of amine <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = (3 - n)^{\circ}  \) </span>

		<p> Thus, nitrogen atom possesses four <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  sp^3  \) </span> hybridised orbitals. In amines, out of these four, three <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  sp^3  \) </span> hybridised orbitals, overlap either with the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  sp^3  \) </span> hybridised orbitals of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  -CH_3  \) </span> group (alkyl group) or with the s orbital of -H atom or with both to form three ia bonds. The remaining fourth <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  sp^3  \) </span> hybridised orbital, being completely filled, does not take part in bond formation. Here it is obvious that there are three a bonds and one lone pair over nitrogen in amines. Thus, all amines, ie, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1^{\circ}, 2^{\circ} \ and \ 3^{\circ}  \) </span> have pyramidal geometry. <br />

					<p> Lower amines are gases or low-boiling liquids, with a characteristic ammonia like smell.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Their b.pt. are higher in comparison with non-polar compounds of same molecular weight (due to intermolecular H-bonding). However, tertiary amines are exceptions of this due to absence of H-bonding. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> These are miscible with water (due to intermolecular H-bonding with <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   H_2O  \) </span> molecules also). </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> All amines are basic due to the presence of lone pair of electron for protonation. Their basicity, ie, availability of lone pair for protonation is affected by following three factors :
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p> Alkyl group substitution (+ I effect) </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p> Steric effect </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p> Solvation effect </p>

						</ol>
					</p>

		<p> Alkyl group have +I effect, thus as their number increases, the electron density over nitrogen increases. Hence, the lone pair will become more available for protonation and results in increased basicity. An evidence in support of this is that in the gas phase, the basicity of following amines increases with increase in the number of methyl groups : </p>
