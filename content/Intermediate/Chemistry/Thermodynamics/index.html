		<h4 class="skill-subheading">System, Surroundings and Boundary</h4>
		<p>A <span class="highlight01"> system </span> is the specific portion of matter, which is under thermodynamic studies. Besides system, the rest of the universe, ie, all other matter that can interact with the system is called <span class="highlight01"> surroundings </span>.The real or imaginary surfaces or lines separating two or more systems or a system from its surroundings is called <span class="highlight01"> boundary </span>. The boundary may be diathermic (ie, allow passage of heat) or adiabatic (ie, does not allow passage of heat).</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Types of System</h4>
		<p>Depending upon the nature of boundary, the system can be of following types :</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Open system </span> An <span class="highlight01"> open system </span> can exchange matter and energy with its surroundings. The boundary here is not sealed and non-insulated thermally, eg, all living systems, car engines, etc. For such a system, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta m \neq 0, \ \Delta E \neq 0  \) </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Close system </span> A <span class="highlight01"> closed system </span> does not exchange matter with its surroundings but can exchange energy in the form of heat, work or radiations ie, the boundary is sealed but not insulated. For such a system, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta m \neq 0, \ \Delta E \neq 0 \) </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Isolated system </span> An <span class="highlight01"> isolated system </span> does not exchange matter or energy from its surroundings ie, the boundary is sealed as well as insulated, eg, thermoflask, etc. For such a system, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta m = 0, \ \Delta E = 0  \) </span>. Besides above written types, the system may be <span class="highlight01"> homogeneous </span> (with identical properties and chemical composition throughout ie, with one phase only) or <span class="highlight01">heterogeneous</span> (consisting of two or more phases).</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Enthalpy</h4>
		<p>The total heat content of a system at constant pressure is called the <span class="highlight01"> enthalpy of the system </span>. Infact, it is the sum of internal energy and the product of pressure-volume work. It is an extensive quantity and represented by the symbol H.<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore H = E + p \Delta V  \) </span>
			<br />
			Its units are lcal or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{kJ}{mol}  \) </span>
		</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Enthalpy of Formation</h4>
		<p>The enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their most stable state of aggregation, is called <span class="highlight01">enthalpy of formation </span> and is denoted by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta_f H  \) </span> eg,<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C (graphite) + 2H_2 (g) \rightarrow CH_4 (g);  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta_f H = - 74.8 k.J  \) </span>
			<br />
			The above enthalpy change under standard condition (1 atm and 198 K) is called <span class="highlight01"> standard heat of formation </span> and is denoted by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta_f H^{ \circ}  \) </span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics</h4>
		<p>According to this laws, "When two objects (maintained at different temperatures) are brought in thermal contact, they exchange heat with each other until they reach a state of thermal equilibrium". <span class="highlight01"> The heat flows always from the object of higher temperature to the object of lower temperature.</span> At thermal equilibrium, the temperature of both of them is same.This idea of thermal equilibrium is called <span class="highlight01"> zeroth law of thermodynamics </span> or <span class="highlight01">law of temperature or law of thermal equilibrium,</span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">First Law of Thermodynamics</h4>
		<p>The <span class="highlight01"> first law of thermodynamics </span> given by Helmholtz and Robert Mayer is similar to the <span class="highlight01"> law of conservation of energy </span>
			<br />
			The law states:
		</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Energy can neither be created nor destroyed although it can be changed from one form to another.</p>

				<li>
					<p>The total energy of the universe remains constant.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The energy of <span class="highlight01"> "an isolated system" </span> is constant. Suppose a system consumes heat (q) and work (W) is done on the system. In this process, the internal energy changes from <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  E_1  \) </span> to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  E_2  \) </span> then:<br />
						or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta E = q + W  \) </span> where <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta E = (E_2 - E_1) = \Delta U  \) </span>
						<br />
						It is the mathematical expression of first law of thermodynamics

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Entropy</h4>
		<p>The extent of randomness in a system may be expressed in terms of <span class="highlight01">entropy</span>, which is defined as, the property of a system which measures the degree of randomness in a system.<br />
			It is generally denoted by S and is a state function ie, change in entropy <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( ( \Delta S) \) </span> depends only on the initial and final states of the system. Thus <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta S = S_{final} - S_{initial}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Units of entropy are <span class="highlight01"> joule per kelvin per mole </span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Second and Thrid Laws of Thermodynamics</h4>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Second Law of Thermodynamics</h5>
		<p>The second law of thermodynamics can be stated as:</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Whenever a spontaneous process takes place, it is always accompanied by an increase in total entropy of the universe</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is impossible to take heat from a hotter reservoir and completely convert into work by a cyclic process without transferring a part of heat to a cooler reservoir. This statement of second law is called <span class="highlight01"> Kelvin's statement </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is impossible for a cyclic process to transfer heat from a body at lower temperature to one at a higher temperature without converting some work to heat. This statement of the second law of thermodynamics is known as <span class="highlight01"> Clausius statement </span>
						<br />
						The above statements (ie, the second law) in simplified form can be stated as <span class="highlight01">"for a spontaneous process in an system, the change in entropy is positive."</span>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>The term universe means the syst and the surroundings. Thus <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta S_{univ} = \Delta S_{syst} + \Delta S_{surr}  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Thrid Law of Thermodynamics</h5>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> The entropy of a perfectly crystalline substance approaches zero as the absolute zero of temperature is approached. </span> This is the statement of <span class="highlight01"> third law of thermodynamics </span> (given by German chemist <span class="highlight01"> Walther Nernst </span> ). It forms the basis from which entropies at other temperatures can be measured.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Gibbs Free Energy</h4>
		<p>The maximum amount of energy available to a system, during a process, that can be converted into useful work is called <span class="highlight01"> free energy </span> or <span class="highlight01"> Gibbs free energy </span> or <span class="highlight01"> Gibbs energy </span>. It was called Gibbs free energy in early literature but in accordance with IUPAC recommendations we shall use the term free energy for it.</p>
		<p>Gibbs energy is the measure of capacity of a system to do useful work. It is denoted by G and given as <br />
			G = H - TS <br />
			where,  H = enthalpy of system <br />
			S = entropy of system <br />
			T = absolute temperature <br />
			but we know that, H = E + pV <br />
			Hence, G = E + pV - TS <br />
			Similarly, change in free energy is expressed as <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta G = \Delta E + \Delta (pV) - \Delta (TS)  \) </span>
			<br />
			If the process is carried out at constant temperature and pressure, then <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta (pV)  \) </span> becomes <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( p \Delta V  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta (TS)  \) </span> becomes <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  T \Delta S  \) </span>
			<br />
			Hence, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta G = \Delta E + p \Delta V - T \Delta S  \) </span> ......(i) <br />
			but <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta E + p \Delta V = \Delta H  \) </span>
			<br />
			thus, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S  \) </span> ......(ii) <br />
			The above Eq. (ii) is called <span class="highlight01"> Gibbs Helmholtz equation </span> and is very useful in predicting the spontaneity of a process
