		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Carbohydrates</h4>
		<p>Carbohydrates are the substances with general formula <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C_x(H_2O)_y  \) </span> ie, hydrates of carbon. However, a number of compounds have been discovered which are carbohydrates by chemical behaviour, but do not conform to the formula <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C_x(H_2O)_y  \) </span>, eg, rhamnose <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (C_6 H_{12} O_5)  \) </span> and deoxyribose <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (C_5 H_{10} O_4).  \) </span>
			<br />
			Similarly, all compounds conforming to the formula <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C_x(H_2O)_y  \) </span> are not necessarily carbohydrates, eg, HCHO, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  CH_3COOH  \) </span> etc. Hence, this definition has been changed now. <br />
			According to modern definition <span class="highlight01"> polyhydroxy aldehydes or polyhydroxy ketones or compounds which can be hydrolysed to one of these are called carbohydrate </span>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Classification of Carbohydrates</h5>
		<p>Carbohydrates are also known as <span class="highlight01"> saccharides </span> and classified according to their behaviour towards hydrolysis.</p>

									<span class="highlight01"> Globular proteins </span> Molecules of globular proteins are folded with spheroidal shapes. The folding takes place in such a way that the lipophilic parts are turned inward and hydrophilic parts tend to move towards the surface,Hydrogen bonding is chiefly intramolecular.<br />
									Hence, they are soluble in water, acids, bases and salts eg, albumin (in eggs), haemoglobin (in blood), all enzymes and most hormones.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Enzymes</h4>
		<p>An enzyme is a specialized protein produced within an organism which is capable of catalysing a specific chemical reaction. Since the enzymes act as catalyst, they are sometimes referred to as <span class="highlight01"> biocatalysts. </span>
			<br />
			A catalyst alters the rate of a chemical reaction, usually without undergoing any change itself. In this respect an enzyme differs from a normal catalyst. The enzyme may participate in a reaction by combining with the substrate.
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Nomenclature and Classification of Enzymes</h5>
		<p>Enzymes are generally named by adding <span class="highlight01"> -ase </span> to the root indicating the substrate on which the enzyme acts. This system was provided by <span class="highlight01"> Duclau x (1883). </span>
			<br />
			Thus <span class="highlight01"> fumarase </span> catalyses the conversion of fumaric acid to malic acid. The <span class="highlight01"> International Union of Biochemistry report of 1962 (revised in 1964) contains a scheme for the classification of enzymes.</span>
			<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Enzymes have been divided into six groups, viz, oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases </span> and <span class="highlight01"> ligases </span> (synthetases)
		</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Oxidoreductases </span> They include a large number of enzymes (221 are listed). They bring about the main energy yielding reactions of living tissue.<br />
						Oxidoreductases include <span class="highlight01"> oxidases </span> and <span class="highlight01"> dehydrogenases </span>. They act by transferring electrons and hydrogen ions.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Transferases </span> They are concerned with the transfer of a group of atoms from one molecule to another. Oxidoreductases and transferases together represent over half the enzymes known.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Hydrolases </span> Complex molecules undergo cleavage, and the elements of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O  \) </span> are added across the bond cleaved by the action of hydrolases</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Lyases </span> They may work in two ways <span class="highlight01"> A group of atoms may be removed from the substrate leaving double bonds, or groups may be added to double bonds without hydrolysis, oxidation or reduction. </span>
						<br />
						The enzymes act on the followimg bonds : C - C, C - O, C - N, C - S and C - halide
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Isomerase </span> They catalyse reactions which bring about intramolecular rearrangement of atoms in substrates.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Ligases (synthetases) </span> They catalyse reactions in which the pyrophosphate bond of ATP is broken down, and linkage takes place between two molecules. <br />
						These enzymes form the following bonds : C - O, C - S, C - N and C - C
