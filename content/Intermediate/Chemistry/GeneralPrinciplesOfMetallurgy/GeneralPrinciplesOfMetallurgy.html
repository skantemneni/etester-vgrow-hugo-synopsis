	<p> Earth crust is a source of many elements. Oxygen is present in most abundance in the earth crust. Among metals, Al is most abundant metal of earth crust and Fe comes second. The percentage of different elements in earth crust is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  O-49\%; \ Si-26\%; \ Al-7.5\%; \ Fe-4.2\%; \ Ca-3.2\%; \ Na-2.4\%; \ K-2.3\%; \ Mg-2.3\%; \ H-1\%; \ other \ elements-2\%.  \) </span> Besides earth crust, some soluble salts of metals, such as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NaCl, MgCl_2, KBr, CaBr_2, KI  \) </span> etc, are also found in sea water. <br />

	<h3 class="skill-heading"> Extraction of Metals (Metallurgy) </h3>
	<p> The process of extraction of metals from their ores is called metallurgy. It involves following steps : </p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Crushing and Grinding of the ore </h4>
		<p> Generally, ores occur in nature as huge lumps. They are crushed into small pieces in gyratory crushers. The crushed ore is then grinded with the help of rollers or in the stamp mill to power form. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Concentration of the ore </h4>
		<p> The process of gangue removal or increase in concentration of ore depends upon the nature of ore and the impurities presen in it. Some of the important methods involved are <span class="highlight01"> Gravity separation or levigation In the gravity separation method, </span> the ore is powdered and then washed in running stream of water. The lighter earthy material and gangue are washed away, while the heavy ore particles remain behind. The oxide ores of iron <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Fe_2O_3  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Fe_2O_4  \) </span> are concentrated by this method. This method is also called levigation.</p>

	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Conversion of Roasted Ore to Oxide </h4>
		<p> The concentrated ore is converted into its oxide by following two ways : <br />
			Roasting The concentrated ore is heated alone or mixed with some other substance, below its melting point in the presence of air, resulting in oxidation of ore and impurities. This type of specialised heating of concentrated ore is called roasting.Usually the sulphide ore is undergoing roasting. In the process of roasting in general, normally the impurities like As and S are oxidised to volatile oxides like <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  SO_2, AS_2O_3  \) </span> etc, and removed. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Reduction of Oxide to Metal </h4>
		<p> Once an ore has been concentrated, it is reduced to free metals, by the several methods. The method used depends on the activity of the metal as measured by its standard reduction potential. The most active metals have the most negative standard reduction potentials and are the most difficult to reduce and the least active metals have the most positive standard reduction potentials and are the easiest to reduce. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Purification of Metal </h4>
		<p> Metals extracted through any of the methods described above are usually contain some impurities. Following methods are used to purify the metals </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Distillation method </span> This process is used for those metals which are easily volatile. In this method, the impure metal is heated in a retort and its vapours are separately condensed in a receiver. The non-volatile impurities are left behind in the retort. This is used for <span class="highlight01"> the purification of Zn, Cd, Hg, etc. </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Liquation method </span> Low melting metals can also be separated by this method. In this method, the impure metal is poured on the sloping hearth of a reverberatory furnance and heated gently to a temperature slightly above the melting point of the metal. The pure molten metal runs out leaving behind the infusable matter (called dross) on the earth. This is used for the <span class="highlight01"> purification of Bi, Sn, Pb, Hg, etc </span>

				<p>Metals are required for a variety of purposes. For this, we need their extraction from the minerals in which they are present and from which their extraction is commercially feasible.These minerals are known as ores. Ores of the metal are associated with many impurities. Removal of these impurities to certain extent is achieved in concentration steps. The concentrated ore is then treated chemically for obtaining the metal. Usually the metal compounds (e.g., oxides, sulphides) are reduced to the metal. The reducing agents used are carbon, CO or even some metals. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> In these reduction processes, the thermodynamic and electrochemical concepts are given due consideration. The metal oxide reacts with a reducing agent; the oxide is reduced to the metal and the reducing agent is oxidised. In the two reactions, the net Gibbs energy change is negative, which becomes more negative on raising the temperature. Conversion of the physical states from solid to liquid or to gas, and formation of gaseous states favours decrease in the Gibbs energy for the entire system. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> This concept is graphically displayed in plots of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \triangle G^{\circleddash}  \) </span> vs T (Ellingham diagram) for such oxidation/reduction reactions at different temperatures. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The concept of electrode potential is useful in the isolation of metals (e.g., Al, Ag, Au) where the sum of the two redox couples is + ve so that the Gibbs energy change is negative. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The metals obtained by usual methods still contain minor impurities. Getting pure metals require refining. Refining process depends upon the differences in properties of the metal and the impurities. Extraction of aluminium is usually carried out from its bauxite ore by leaching it with NaOH. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Sodium aluminate, thus formed, is separated and then neutralised to give back the hydrated oxide, which is then electrolysed using cryolite as a flux. Extraction of iron is done by reduction of its oxide ore in blast furnace. Copper is extracted by smelting and heating in a reverberatory furnace. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Extraction of zinc from zinc oxides is done using coke. Several methods are employed in refining the metal. Metals, in general, are very widely used and have contributed significantly in the development of a variety of industries.</p>

		<p>Although thermodynamically feasible, in practice, magnesium metal is not used for the reduction of alumina in the metallurgy of aluminium. Why? <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution</span>
			<br />
			Temperatures above the point of intersection of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Al_2O_3  \) </span> and MgO curves, magnesium can reduce alumina. But the temperature required would be so high that the process will be uneconomic and technologically difficult.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 3:</h4>
		<p>Why is the reduction of a metal oxide easier if the metal formed is in liquid state at the temperature of reduction? <br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution</span>
			<br />
			The entropy is higher if the metal is in liquid state than when it is in solid state. The value of entropy change <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \triangle{s}  \) </span> of the reduction process is more on + ve side when the metal formed is in liquid state and the metal oxide being reduced is in solid state. Thus the value of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \triangle{G^{\circleddash}}  \) </span> becomes more on negative side and the reduction becomes easier.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 4:</h4>
		<p>At a site, low grade copper ores are available and zinc and iron scraps are also available. Which of the two scraps would be more suitable for reducing the leached copper ore and why?<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution</span>
			<br />
			Zinc being above iron in the electrochemical series (more reactive metal is zinc), the reduction will be faster in case zinc scraps are used. But zinc is costlier metal than iron so using iron scraps will be advisable and advantageous.</p>
