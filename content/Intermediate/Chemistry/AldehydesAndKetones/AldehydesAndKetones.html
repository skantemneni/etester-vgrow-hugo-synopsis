	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Aldehydes, ketones </span> and <span class="highlight01"> carboxylic acids </span> are some of the important classes of organic compounds containing carbonyl group.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>These are highly polar molecules. Therefore, they boil at higher temperatures than the hydrocarbons and weakly polar compounds such as ethers of comparable molecular masses.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The lower members are more soluble in water because they form hydrogen bonds with water. The higher members, because of large size of hydrophobic chain of carbon atoms, are insoluble in water but soluble in common organic solvents. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Aldehydes are prepared by dehydrogenation or controlled oxidation of primary alcohols and controlled or selective reduction of acyl halides. Aromatic aldehydes may also be prepared by oxidation of</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>methylbenzene with chromyl chloride or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  CrO_3  \) </span>in the presence of acetic anhydride,</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>formylation of arenes with carbon monoxide and hydrochloric acid in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride, and</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>cuprous chloride or by hydrolysis of benzal chloride.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Ketones are prepared by oxidation of secondary alcohols and hydration of alkynes. Ketones are also prepared by reaction of acyl chloride with dialkylcadmium.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> A good method for the preparation of aromatic ketones is the <span class="highlight01"> Friedel-Crafts acylation </span> of aromatic hydrocarbons with acyl chlorides or anhydrides. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Both aldehydes and ketones can be prepared by ozonolysis of alkenes. Aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions onto the carbonyl group with a number of nucleophiles such as, HCN, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NaHSO_3  \) </span> , alcohols (or diols), ammonia derivatives, and Grignard reagents. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \alpha  \) </span> -hydrogens in aldehydes and ketones are acidic. Therefore, aldehydes and ketones having at least one  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \alpha  \) </span> - hydrogen, undergo Aldol condensation in the presence of a base to give  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \alpha  \) </span> - hydroxyaldehydes (aldol) and  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \alpha  \) </span> - hydroxyketones(ketol), respectively.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Aldehydes having no  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \alpha  \) </span> - hydrogen undergo Cannizzaro reaction in the presence of concentrated alkali. Aldehydes and ketones are reduced to alcohols with <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NaBH_4, \ LiAlH_4  \) </span>, or by catalytic hydrogenation. The carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to a methylene group by Clemmensen reduction or Wolff-Kishner reduction. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Aldehydes are easily oxidised to carboxylic acids by mild oxidising reagents such as Tollens' reagent and Fehling's reagent. These oxidation reactions are used to distinguish aldehydes from ketones. Carboxylic acids are prepared by the oxidation of primary alcohols, aldehydes and alkenes by hydrolysis of nitriles, and by treatment of Grignard reagents with carbon dioxide. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Aromatic carboxylic acids are also prepared by side-chain oxidation of alkylbenzenes. Carboxylic acids are considerably more acidic than alcohols and most of simple phenols. Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols with <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  LiAlH_4  \) </span> , or better with diborane in ether solution and also undergo  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \alpha  \) </span> - halogenation with <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Cl_2  \) </span>  and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Br_2  \) </span> in the presence of red phosphorus (Hell-Volhard Zelinsky reaction). Methanal, ethanal, propanone, benzaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid and benzoic acid are highly useful compounds in industry.</p>

		<p>Arrange the following compounds in the increasing order of their boiling points: <br />

			<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>
			<br />
			The molecular masses of these compounds are in the range of 72 to 74. Since only butan-1-ol molecules are associated due to extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding, therefore, the boiling point of butan-1-ol would be the highest. Butanal is more polar than ethoxyethane. Therefore, the intermolecular dipole-dipole attraction is stronger in the former. n-Pentane molecules have only weak van der Waals forces. Hence increasing order of boiling points of the given compounds is as follows: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2CH_3 &lt; H_5C_2-O-C_2H_5 &lt; CH_3CH_2CH_2CHO &gt; CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2OH  \) </span>

		<p>Would you expect benzaldehyde to be more reactive or less reactive in nucleophilic addition reactions than propanal? Explain your answer.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>
			<br />
			The carbon atom of the carbonyl group of benzaldehyde is less electrophilic than carbon atom of the carbonyl group present in propanal. The polarity of the carbonyl group is reduced in benzaldehyde due to resonance as shown below and hence it is less reactive than propanal.</p>

		<p>An organic compound (A) with molecular formula <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C_8H_8O  \) </span> forms an orange-red precipitate with 2,4-DNP reagent and gives yellow precipitate on heating with iodine in the presence of sodium hydroxide.

Identify the compounds (A) and (B) and explain the reactions involved.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>
			<br />
			(A) forms 2,4-DNP derivative. Therefore, it is an aldehyde or a ketone. Since it does not reduce Tollens' or Fehling reagent, (A) must be a ketone. (A) responds to iodoform test. Therefore, it should be a methyl ketone. The molecular formula of (A) indicates high degree of unsaturation, yet it does not decolourise bromine water or Baeyer's reagent. This indicates the presence of unsaturation due to an aromatic ring. <br />
			Compound (B), being an oxidation product of a ketone should be a carboxylic acid. The molecular formula of (B) indicates that it should be benzoic acid and compound (A) should, therefore, be a monosubstituted aromatic methyl ketone. The molecular formula of (A) indicates that it should be phenyl methyl ketone (acetophenone). Reactions are as follows:</p>
