		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Introduction of Polymers</h4>
		<p>The term polymer is coined from two Greek words : 'poly' means many and 'mer' means units or parts. Thus, <span class="highlight01"> polymers may be defined as the high molecular mass compounds which are prepared by the combination of a large number of one or more types of simple molecules or units.</span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Classification on the basis of Source of Availability</h4>
		<p>On this basis are classified into following three categories</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Natural Polymers </span> These are synthesised by plants and animals. Some of these such as polysaccharides, proteins and nucleic acids are essential for the existence of life,<br />
						so these are also known as <span class="highlight01"> biopolymers </span>. These are generally biodegradable. Examples of such polymers are </p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01">
									Nucleic acids (such as DNA, RNA) These are the polymers of nucleotides (ie, base + sugar + phosphate).</span>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01"> Proteins </span> These are the polymers of amino acids, which are joined together by the peptide bonds</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01"> Natural rubber </span> These are the polymers of derivatives of buta-1, 3-diene.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01"> Polysaccharides (such as strach and cellulose) </span> These are the polymers of monosaccharides, which are joined together through glycosidic linkages</p>
						</li>
					</ol> 
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Semisynthetic polymers </span> These are dervied from natural polymers by chemical modifications. These are called man made polymers. Their examples includes </p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01"> Cellulose acetate </span> It is obtained by the acetylation of cellulose followed by the partial hydrolysis. It is less inflammable and used in making photographic films, lacquers and varnishes</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01"> Rayon </span> It contains purified cellulose in the form of long fibres. When cellulose is treated with NaOH and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  CS_2  \) </span> viscose, a colloidal dispersion, is obtained and when the viscose is forced through fine holes into dilute sulphuric acid, rayon is obtained.<br />
								Rayon, a biodegradable polymer, absorbs moisture and is used for making textiles, carpets, tyre-clord etc. It has a shine like silk, so also known as artificial silk</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01"> Cellophane </span> When the viscose, obtained above, is forced through a long narrow slit into an acid bath and then, softens with glycerol, cellophane is obtained. Unlike plastics, it absorbs moisture.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<span class="highlight01"> Cellulose nitrate (gun cotton) </span> These are obtained by the nitration of cellulose </p>
						</li>
					</ol> 
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Synthetic Polymer </span> These are man made polymer. Such polymers have high tensile strength. Due to their extensive use in daily life as well as industry, these are of great importance,<br />
						eg. polysthene <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  -[- CH_2 - CH_2 -]-_n  \) </span> , polyvinyl chloride<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  -[- CH_2 - CHCl]_n  \) </span> , polystyrene <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  -[- CH_2 - CHC_6H_5 -]-_n  \) </span>, nylon <span class="highlight01"> nylon-6, 6, bakelite, </span>synthetic rubber etc.

			<li>
				<p>
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Polymers  \) </span> are defined as high molecular mass macromolecules, which consist of repeating structural units derived from the corresponding monomers. These polymers may be of natural or synthetic origin and are classified in a number of ways.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In the presence of an organic peroxide initiator, the alkenes and their derivatives undergo addition polymerisation or chain growth polymerisation through a free radical mechanism. Polythene, teflon, orlon, etc. are formed by addition polymerisation of an appropriate alkene or its derivative.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Condensation polymerisation reactions are shown by the interaction of bi - or poly functional monomers containing - <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NH_2  \) </span>, - OH and - COOH groups. This type of polymerisation proceeds through the elimination of certain simple molecules as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O, \ CH_3OH  \) </span> , etc.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Formaldehyde reacts with phenol and melamine to form the corresponding condensation polymer products. The condensation polymerisation progresses through step by step and is also called as step growth polymerisation. Nylon, bakelite and dacron are some of the important examples of condensation polymers. However, a mixture of two unsaturated monomers exhibits copolymerisation and forms a co-polymer containing multiple units of each monomer. Natural rubber is a cis 1, 4-polyisoprene and can be made more tough by the process of vulcanisation with sulphur. Synthetic rubbers are usually obtained by copolymerisation of alkene and 1, 3 butadiene derivatives.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In view of the potential environmental hazards of synthetic polymeric wastes, certain <span class="highlight01"> biodegradable polymers </span> such as PHBV and Nylon-2- Nylon-6 are developed as alternatives.</p>
