	<p> "A chemical bond is a kind of inter-atomic, inter-molecular or inter-ionic attraction which holds two constituents together". <span class="highlight01"> In simplest words we can say it is the attractive forces between two atoms or molecules or ions which we consider as a bond. </span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Modern Theory of Chemical Bonding</h4>
		<p>The cause or basis of attractive forces or chemical bond, can be easily understood if we look at structure of an atom having positive nucleus and negative electrons. When two atoms come closer to combine, the attractive and repulsive forces begin to operate between them as :</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Ionic Bond Or Electrovalent Bond</h4>
		<p> The attractive forces of ionic bond strength (electrostatic force of attraction) are developed between an <span class="highlight01"> electropositive atom </span> (ie, an atom with tendency to loose electron and convert into a cation) and an <span class="highlight01"> electropositive atom </span> (ie an atom with tendency to gain electron and convert into an anion) due to complete transfer of electron from former to latter. The number of electrons an atom loses (or gains) during the ionic bond formation is called <span class="highlight01"> electrovalency </span> of that atom.</p>

					<p> A covalent bond is formed when the orbital of one atom overlaps with the orbital of another atom, each of the orbital containing one unpaired electron.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The two atomic orbital in such a case, merge to form a single <span class="highlight01"> bond orbital </span> or a <span class="highlight01"> localized molecular orbital </span>, which is occupied by both the electrons.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> The two electrons occupying the bond orbital must have opposite spins. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Each electron may be considered to belong to both the atomic nuclei.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>As a result of overlapping, there is maximum electron density somewhere between the two atoms. <span class="highlight01"> The electrostatic attraction between the nuclei and the accumulated electron clouds between them provides a large part of the binding force of covalent bond.</span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The neutralization of spin magnetic moments of the two electrons taking part in the bond formation also contributes to the binding force.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Hybridisation</h3>
	<p>The process of hybridisation involves the mixing of orbitals of almost similar energy belonging to same atom, to form the same number of orbitals of exactly equal energy. The new orbitals formed are called hybrid orbitals. The phenomenon in actual sense involves redistribution of energy. </p>
