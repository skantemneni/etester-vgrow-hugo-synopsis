		<p>A substitution reaction is that which involves the direct replacement (displacement or substitution) of an atom or a group of atoms in an organic molecule by another atom or group of atoms without any change in the remaining part of the molecule. The product obtained as a result of substitution is called the <span class="highlight01"> substitution product </span> and the new atom or group of atoms which enters the molecule is called a <span class="highlight01"> substituent, </span> eg, </p>

					<p>Substitution reactions can further be classified into three categories on the basis of intermediate species which begins the reaction. These are <br />
						<span class="highlight01"> Free radical substitution </span> Substitution reaction brought about by free radicals are called <span class="highlight01"> free radical substitutions </span> . The best example of this kind of reactions is <span class="highlight01"> halogenation of alkanes </span> in the presence of sunlight or heat ie, <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{substrate -1}{R-CH_3} + \underset{substrate -2 \ or \ reagent}{X_2} \xrightarrow[heat]{Sunlight} \underset{Product-1}{RCH_2X} + \underset{Product-2}{HX}  \) </span>
						<br />
						Halogenation reactions	are mainly given by those hydrocarbons which have at least one hydrogen on spa hybrid carbon.

						Free radical reactions run under following three steps (These reactions are infact chain reactions) <br />
						<span class="highlight01"> Step I :Chain initiation step  </span>  It involves the formation of free radicals from the reagent ie, <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   Reagent \xrightarrow[Heat \ or]{hv \ or \ free \ radical \ initiators} two \ free \ radicals  \) </span>
						<br />
						eg, for the above halogenation reaction <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  X_2 \xrightarrow[Heat \ or \ hv \ or]{free \ radical \ initiators} X^{\cdot} + X^{\cdot}  \) </span>
						<br />
						<span class="highlight01"> This step can be recognised by the fact that free radicals are present on the product side ie, after the arrow. </span>
						<br />
						<span class="highlight01"> Step II : Chain propagation step  </span>It Involves attack of adicals formed in step I on the substrate ie, <br />
						<div class="synopsis-image"> 
							<img src="103202023_image-2.png" alt="image2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
						 </div>
						eg, in the above reaction. <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   \underset{substrate -1}{R-CH_3} + \underset{free \ radical}{X^{\cdot}} \rightarrow  \underset{free \ radical}{R \overset{\cdot}CH_2} + \underset{Product-2}{HX}  \) </span>
						<br />
						The free radical we got above continues the process as follows <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   \underset{free \ radical}{R- \overset{\cdot}CH_2} + \underset{substrate -2 \ or \ reagent}{X_2} \rightarrow  \underset{Product-1}{RCH_2X} + \underset{free \ radical}{X^{\cdot}}  \) </span>
						<br />
						This free radical formed further attacks on substrate-1 <br />
						Thus, the steps continue repeating till one of the substrates is finished. <br />
						<span class="highlight01"> (This step can be recognised by the presence of free radicals on both the sides of arrows.) </span>
						<br />
						<span class="highlight01"> Step III : Chain termination step </span> This step comes into action only when one of the substrates is finished. Here the free radicals which are present start joining at random, resulting to various kinds of products in traces ie, <br />
						For the above reaction : <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \overset{\cdot}X + \overset{\cdot}X  \rightarrow X_2  \\\\[3pt]
							R - \overset{\cdot}CH_2 + R - \overset{\cdot}CH_2 \rightarrow R - CH_2CH_2 - R  \\\\[3pt]
							R-\overset{\cdot}CH_2 + \overset{\cdot}X \rightarrow R - CH_2X  \end{align}  \) </span>
						<br />
						<span class="highlight01"> (This step can be recognised by the presence of free radicals before the arrow only) </span>

				<li>
					<p>Following is the decreasing order of reactivity of halogens. <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_2 &gt; Cl_2 &gt; Br_2 &gt; I_2  \) </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Following is the decreasing order of ease of abstraction of different kinds of hydrogens. <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  3^{\circ} \ hydrogen &gt; 2^{\circ} \ hydrogen &gt; 2^{\circ} \ hydrogen &gt;  CH_3 - H  \) </span>
