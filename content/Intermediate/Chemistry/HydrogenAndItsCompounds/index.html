		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Hydrogen</h4>
		<p>Hydrogen is the first element of Periodic Table with atomic number 1 and atomic weight 1.008. It is the simplest element known and contains 1 proton in its nucleus with 1 planetary electron present in the s-orbital of K-shell or 1st orbit.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Neutron is absent in its nucleus </span>. The atomic form occurs only at high temperatures and normally, it is seen as a diatomic molecule called <span class="highlight01">dihydrogen</span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Occurrence of Hydrogen</h4>
		<p>Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe (70% of universe total mass). However, it does not occur in the earth's atmosphere in its free form because of the absence of enough gravitational pull to hold the lighter hydrogen molecules but forms 90% of Sun's atmosphere.<br />
			The giant planets Jupiter and Saturn consist mostly of hydrogen.

						<br />
						Metals like Ni, Pt, Pd, Fe, Au, etc, can adsorb or occlude large volumes of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2  \) </span> gas at different temperatures ( <span class="highlight01"> Pd can occlude 1000 times of its own volume </span>).

		<p>The compounds of hydrogen in which hydrogen is suppose to present as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H^{-}  \) </span> are called hydrides. The oxidation state of H in these compounds is -1.</p>

					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Ionic or salt like hydrides </span> These are the compounds of hydrogen with most of the s-block elements. These are formed by transfer of electrons from metal to hydrogen atom.<br />
						These are white crystalline solids, have ionic lattices, high boiling and melting points and behave as salts. They can conduct electricity only in fused or molten state.<br />
						<span class="highlight01">Their density is higher than that of metals </span>. Their aqueous solutions are strongly alkaline. These hydrides are famous for complex formation and are used as good reducing agents, eg,<br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  LiH + AlH_3 \rightarrow Li (AlH_4)  \\\\[3pt]
							NaH + BH_3 \rightarrow Na(BH_4)  \end{align}  \) </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Molecular or covalent hydrides </span> These are the compounds of hydrogen with p-block elements. Their bonds are mostly covalent in character (in some cases partly covalent and partly ionic character eg, HF).<br />
						These have molecular lattices, soft in texture, with low m.p. and b.p. and low electrical conductivity. Acidic character in these hydrides increases while moving left to right in a period, eg,<br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  NH_3 \rightarrow base, \ H_2O \rightarrow netural, \ HF \rightarrow acid  \\\\[3pt]
							PH_3 \rightarrow weak base, \ H_2S \rightarrow weak acid, \ HCl \rightarrow strong acid  \end{align}  \) </span>

						The molecular hydrides are named with the suffix-ane eg, phosphane <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (PH_3); \ oxidane (H_2O); \ azane (NH_3)  \) </span> etc, and are of following three types :

								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<span class="highlight01"> Electron precise hydrides with </span> elements of 14 group, eg <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  CH_4  \) </span>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<span class="highlight01"> Electron rich hydrides with </span> elements of 15, 16 and 17 group, eg, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O, \ NH_3, \ HF  \) </span> etc. Here, the excess electron is being present as lone pair ( <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NH_3 \rightarrow 1 \ lone pair; \ H_2O \rightarrow 2 \ lone pairs; \ HF \rightarrow 3 \ lone pairs  \) </span> ). <br />
									The presence of lone pair and highly electronegative elements like O, N and F results in hydrogen bond formation. Presence of hydrogen bonds leads to high boiling points, high permittivities and aggregation in such compounds.

				<p>Hydrogen is the lightest atom with only one electron. Loss of this electron results in an elementary particle, the proton. Thus, it is unique in character. It has three isotopes, namely : <span class="highlight01">protium (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ^1_1H  \) </span> ) </span> , <span class="highlight01"> deuterium (D or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ^2_1H  \) </span> ) </span> and <span class="highlight01"> tritium (T or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ^3_1H  \) </span>)  </span> . Amongst these three, only tritium is radioactive.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Inspite of its resemblance both with alkali metals and halogens, it occupies a separate position in the periodic table because of its unique properties.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. In the free state it is almost not found in the earth’s atmosphere. However, in the combined state, it is the third most abundant element on the earth's surface.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Dihydrogen on the industrial scale is prepared by the <span class="highlight01"> water-gas shift </span> reaction from petrochemicals. It is obtained as a byproduct by the electrolysis of brine.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The H-H <span class="highlight01">  bond dissociation enthalpy </span> of dihydrogen (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  435.88 \ kJ \ mol^{-1}  \) </span> ) is the highest for a single bond between two atoms of any elements. This property is made use of in the atomic hydrogen torch which generates a temperature of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sim  \) </span> 4000K and is ideal for welding of high melting metals. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Though dihydrogen is rather inactive at room temperature because of very high negative dissociation enthalpy, it combines with almost all the elements under appropriate conditions to form hydrides. All the type of hydrides can be classified into three categories: ionic or saline hydrides, covalent or molecular hydrides and metallic or non-stoichiometric hydrides. Alkali metal hydrides are good reagents for preparing other hydride compounds. Molecular hydrides (e.g., <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  B_2H_6, \ CH_4, \ NH_3, \ H_2O)  \) </span> are of great importance in day-to-day life. Metallic hydrides are useful for ultrapurification of dihydrogen and as dihydrogen storage media.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Among the other chemical reactions of dihydrogen, <span class="highlight01"> reducing reactions </span> leading to the formation hydrogen halides, water, ammonia, methanol, vanaspati ghee, etc. are of great importance. In metallurgical process, it is used to reduce metal oxides. In space programmes, it is used as a rocket fuel. In fact, it has promising potential for use as a non-polluting fuel of the near future <span class="highlight01">(Hydrogen Economy) </span> .</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Water is the most common and abundantly available substance. It is of a great chemical and biological significance. The ease with which water is transformed from liquid to solid and to gaseous state allows it to play a vital role in the biosphere. The water molecule is highly polar in nature due to its bent structure. This property leads to hydrogen bonding which is the maximum in ice and least in water vapour. The polar nature of water makes it:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p> a very good solvent for ionic and partially ionic compounds; </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> to act as an amphoteric (acid as well as base) substance; and </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> to form hydrates of different types.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Its property to dissolve many salts, particularly in large quantity, makes it hard and hazardous for industrial use. Both temporary and permanent hardness can be removed by the use of zeolites, and synthetic ion-exchangers.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> Heavy water </span> , <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  D_2O  \) </span>  is another important compound which is manufactured by the electrolytic enrichment of normal water. It is essentially used as a moderator in nuclear reactors.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Hydrogen peroxide </span> , <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O_2  \) </span> has an interesting non-polar structure and is widely used as an industrial bleach and in pharmaceutical and pollution control treatment of industrial and domestic effluents. </p>
