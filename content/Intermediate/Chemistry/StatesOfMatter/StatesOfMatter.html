	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Intermolecular Theory </h4>
		<p> Intermolecular forces are forces of attraction or repulsion which act between neighboring particles (atoms, molecules or ions). They are weak compared to the intramolecular forces, the forces which keep a molecule together. For example the covalent bond, involving the sharing of electron pairs between atoms is much stronger than the forces present between the neighboring molecules. They are an essential part of force fields used in molecular mechanics. <br />
			The investigation of intermolecular forces starts from macroscopic observations which point out the existence and action of forces at a molecular level. These observations include non-ideal gas thermodynamic behavior reflected by virial coefficients, vapour pressure, viscosity, superficial tension and absorption data.

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Thermal Energy </h4>
		<p> Thermal energy is most easily defined in the context of the ideal gas, which is well approximated by a monatomic gas at low pressure. The ideal gas is a gas of particles considered as point objects of perfect spherical symmetry that interact only by elastic collisions and fill a volume such that their mean free path between collisions is much larger than their diameter. <br />
			The mechanical kinetic energy of a single particle is <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  E_{kinetic} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2  \) </span>
			<br />
			where m is the particle's mass and v is its velocity. The thermal energy of the gas sample consisting of N atoms is given by the sum of these energies, assuming no losses to the container or the environment: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  U_{thermal} = \frac{1}{2} N m \overline{v^2} = \frac{3}{2} N k T  \) </span>, <br />
			where the line over the velocity term indicates that the average value is calculated over the entire ensemble. The total thermal energy of the sample is proportional to the macroscopic temperature by a constant factor accounting for the three translational degrees of freedom of each particle and the Boltzmann constant. The Boltzmann constant converts units between the microscopic model and the macroscopic temperature. This formalism is the basic assumption that directly yields the ideal gas law and it shows that for the ideal gas, the internal energy U consists only of its thermal energy: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  U = U_{thermal}  \) </span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Nomenclature Of The Elements </h4>
		<p> CNIC (Commission on Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry) appointed by IUPAC in 1994, approved official names for elements with atomic number 104 to 109. For the elements having Z &gt; 109, IUPAC recommended a nomenclature to be followed for naming these elements until their names are officially recognised. This nomenclature is based on the Latin words for the atomic numbers of the elements. <br />
			Very recently, on August 16, 2003, IUPAC approved the name for the element of atomic number 110, as Darmstadtium, with symbol Ds. <br />
			The names are derived by using roots for the three digits in the atomic number of the elements and adding the ending -ium. The roots for the numbers are as

		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Shape and volume </span> A liquid state is intermediate in character between the complete molecular randomness (in gases) and the orderly arrangement of molecules (in crystalline solids). In liquids, the molecules are moving sufficiently slow for the intermolecular forces of attraction to hold them together in a definite volume.<br />
						However the molecular motion is too rapid for the attraction force to fix the molecules into definite positions of a crystal lattice. <span class="highlight01"> Hence a liquid retains its volumes but not its shape. </span> The liquid therefore, flows to assume the shape of container.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Density </span> The molecules in a liquid are closely packed, thus their densities are many times more than the vapour. However, the density is low as compared to solids, eg, water registers an increase of 1700 times in density at 373 K and 1 atm pressure. when linuefied from its vanour stare. An increase in temperature increases the volume of most liquids slightly and consequently decreases the liquid density.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Compressibility </span> Liquids are virtually incompressible. There are very slight changes in volume with the changes in temperature or pressure. This is due to strong forces of attraction and very small "free space" available in liquids.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Evaporation </span> The process of change of liquids into vapour is termed as evaporation. Like the gases, the liquids too have a distribution of kinetic energy ranging from very low values to very high values. As a result of this, the highly energetic fractions of molecules at the surface overcome the intermolecular attraction and escape as vapour.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Vapour pressure </span> The process by which molecules of liquids go into the gaseous state (vapour) is called vaporisation or evaporation. The reverse process whereby gas molecules become liquid molecules is called condensation.<br />
						There is a dynamic equilibrium estabilished between the liquid and the vapour at the given temperature.<br />
