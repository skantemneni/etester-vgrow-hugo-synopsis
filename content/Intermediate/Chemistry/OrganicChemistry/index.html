		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Isomerism</h4>
		<p> Those compounds which have the same molecular formula but differ in properties, are called isomers and the phenomenon is called isomerism. Since, isomers have the same molecular formula, ie, same atoms, the difference in their properties must be due to different modes of combinations or arrangement of atoms within the molecule. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Types of Isomerism</h5>
		<p>There are two main types of isomerism ie,
		</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p> Structural isomerism</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Stereo isomerism</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> Structural isomerism </span> Structural isomerism When the isomerism is due to difference in the arrangement of atoms within the molecules (without any reference to space) the phenomenon is called <span class="highlight01"> structural isomerism </span>. In other words, we can say that structural isomers are the compounds which have same molecular formula but different structural formulae, hence different properties. The structural isomerism is also called <span class="highlight01"> constitutional isomeris. </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Chain Isomerism</h5>
		<p>The <span class="highlight01"> chain isomers </span> have the same molecular formula but differ in order in which the carbon atoms are bonded to each other, eg, n-pentane (normal chain), 2-methyl butane (iso-chain) and 2,2-dimethyl propane (neo-chain) </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Position Isomerism</h5>
		<p>In position isomerism, the difference lies in the position substituent group or atom in the same chain, eg, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  CH_3 - \underset{2-methylpentane}{CH_2 - CH_2}  - \overset{\overset{CH_3}|}{CH_3} - CH_3  \\\\[3pt]
				CH_3 - \underset{3-methylpentane}{CH_2 - \overset{\overset{CH_3}|}{CH_3} - CH_2} - CH_3  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Carbon chain length is same but position of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  - CH_3  \) </span> group is different.
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Functional Isomerism</h5>
		<p> When different functional groups are attached to the same carbon chain ie, those compounds which have same molecular formula but different structures due to difference in functional groups attached are called <span class="highlight01"> functional isomerism </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   C_2H_6O  \) </span> have two functional isomers ie, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   C_2H_5OH  \) </span> (ethyl alcohol) and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   CH_3OCH_3  \) </span> (dimethyl ether)
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Ring Chain Isomerism</h5>
		<p> If one isomer has open chain structure and the other has cyclic structure then isomers are known as <span class="highlight01"> ring chain isomers and isomerism </span> is called <span class="highlight01"> ring chain isomerism . </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Isotopic Isomerism</h5>
		<p>The isomerism arised due to the presence of different isotopes of an element in the compound is called <span class="highlight01"> isotopic isomerism. </span> eg, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  D_2O  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ^{12}CH_4  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ^{14}CH_4  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Geometrical Isomerism</h5>
		<p>When a <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \pi  \) </span> - bond is formed between two atoms it restricts the free rotation of atoms around its axis. This gives rise to two different structural formulae (properties of these forms differ due to different arrangement of atoms about double bonds in alkenes or about single bonds in cyclic compounds). This isomerism which arises due to difference in spatial arrangement of groups about the </p>

				<li>
					<p>Doubly bonded C-atoms in <span class="highlight01">  alkenes, </span>

					<p>Doubly bonded C and N-atoms in <span class="highlight01"> oximes, </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Doubly bonded N-atoms in diazo compounds, is called <span class="highlight01"> geometrical isomerism. </span>

				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Optical Isomerism</h5>
		<p>Compounds with similar physical as well as chemical properties and with difference only in their behaviour towards polarized light are called <span class="highlight01"> optical isomers </span> and their this property as <span class="highlight01">optical isomerism. </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Optical Isomers</h5>
		<p>Without asymmetric C-atom besides such compounds which have asymmetrical C-atoms, there are certain compounds found which are optically active but lack any asymmetric C-atom. These compounds show optical activity just because of the fact that their molecule is chiral. </p>

		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Electromeric Effect</h5>
		<p>The electromeric effect can be defined as <span class="highlight01"> "Polarity produced in a multiple bonded compound as a reagent approaches it" </span>  When a <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \pi  \) </span> bond is exposed to a reagent, the two <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \pi  \) </span>  electrons are completely transferred to any of the one atom forming such a bond, thus producing polarity. <span class="highlight01"> This is a temporary effect and brought into play only in the presence of attacking reagent. </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Mesomeric Effect</h5>
		<p>The <span class="highlight01"> mesomeric effect </span> is defined as "polarity produced in a molecule due to conjugation". The effect is transmitted in a similar way as seen in inductive effect with the difference that the intensity of mesomeric effect remains same throughout the molecule unlike to inductive effect whose intensity decreases as we move away from the cause of polarity. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Methods of Purification</h4>
		<p> The methods which are generally employed for the purification of organic compounds are :</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Filtration </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Crystallisation</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Fractional crystallisation</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p> Differential extraction </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Chromatography. </p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Filtration</h5>
		<p>Filtration is used to separate the insoluble solid compound of the mixture from the soluble components in a given solvent. Sometime we use the filtrate of hot solution for separation. If the process of filtration is slow then it is carried out under reduced pressure using a Buchner funnel and a filter pump. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Crystallisation</h5>
		<p>This method is used to purify organic solids which dissolve in a particular solvent either as such or on heating while the impurities does not dissolve. A hot concentrated solution of the compound is prepared and this upon filtration and cooling gives the crystals of the pure compound. <br />
			The solvents commonly used for dissolving organic solids are water, alcohol, ether, chloroform, benzene, petroleum ether, etc eg, sugar having common salt as impurity, can be crystallised through hot ethanol as it is soluble in hot ethanol but, common salt does not simillarly, hot water is used to separate a mixture of benzoic acid and naphthalene.
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Fractional Crystallisation</h5>
		<p>This method is used to purify such mixtures, the components of which have different solubilities in same solvent. A hot concentrated solution of mixture is prepared and is allowed to cool. The less soluble component crystallises out earlier as compared to more soluble one. The various fractions are separated from time to time. Now these fractions are subjected to crystallisation. The mixture of glucose and fructose; sodium sulphate and sodium dichromate, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  KClO_3 + KCl  \) </span> is separated by this method. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Sublimation</h5>
		<p> This process is employed for those solids which convert directly into vapours on heating without converting into liquid phase and the vapours upon cooling give back the solid. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   solid  \overset{heat}{\underset{cool}\rightleftharpoons} Vapours  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Distillation</h5>
		<p>This method is applied if organic liquid is stable at its boiling point and contains a non-volatile impurity. When the given liquid is heated to its boiling point, it is converted into vapours and the vapours on cooling condense to give back the original liquid in its pure form. The liquid o obtained is called distillate and the process is distillation. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Differential Extraction</h5>
		<p>The process of <span class="highlight01"> differential extraction </span> is used to separate a given organic compound present in an aqueous solution from water present in it. The process involves shaking of solution with a suitable organic solvent in which compound is more soluble as compared to water such as ether, chloroform or benzene. in a separating funnel. While performing such an act one point should be kept in mind that solvent and water must not be miscible with each other. In order to get the more amount of organic solvent, the process is repeated again and again with same sample. eg, benzoic acid is separated from water by using benzene.</p>

		 </div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Chromatography</h5>
		<p> It is the modern technique used for separation and purification of organic compounds (available in small amounts). The method was discovered by Tswett (a Russian botanist) in 1906. He used the technique for the separation of coloured pigments from a plant.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Qualitative Analysis</h4>
		<p> The qualitative analysis of an organic compound implies the detection of all the major elements which can be present in it with the help of suitable chemical tests.</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Detection of Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen</h5>
		<p>The detection of carbon and hydrogen is done with the help of copper oxide test. In the test the compound is mixed with double the amount of pure and dry copper oxide. The mixture is heated in a hard glass test tube which is fitted with a bulb containing delivery tube as shown in the figure below </p>
