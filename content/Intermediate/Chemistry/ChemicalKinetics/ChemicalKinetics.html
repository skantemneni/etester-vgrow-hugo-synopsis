		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Rate of Reaction</h4>
		<p>The rate or speed or velocity of a reaction is the rate of change of concentration of reactants or products in unit time. When a reaction occurs, the concentration of reactants starts decreasing while the concentration of products starts increasing. <br />
			Therefore, <br />
			Rate of a reaction  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = \frac{decrease \ in \ the \ concentration \ of \ reactants}{time \ interval}  \) </span>
			<br />
			or Rate of a reaction  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = \frac{increase \ in \ the \ concentration \ of \ products}{time \ interval}  \) </span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Factors Affecting Rate of Reaction</h4>
		<p> The factors which affect the rate of reaction are as follows </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Concentration of reactants </span> An increase in concentration of reactants increases the reaction rate. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Nature of reactants </span> The nature of bonds in a molecule influences the rate of reaction at which it changes into products </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Temperature </span> Reaction rates are normally favoured by increase of temperature. The temperature effect is expressed in terms of temperature coefficient which is the ratio of the velocity constant of a reaction at two temperature differing by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10^{\circ} C.  \) </span>
						<br />
						Temperature coefficient  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = \frac{K_{(t +10)^{\circ} C}}{K_{t^{\circ} C}}  \) </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Presence of catalyst </span> Presence of catalyst increases the rate of reaction by lowering the energy barrier. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Surface area of reactants </span> The rate of reaction increases as the surface area of the reactant increases. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Presence of light </span> Reaction rate normally becomes faster in presence of light. Light gives the necessary activation energy for starting the reaction. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Molecularity of Reaction</h4>
		<p>Molecularity of a reaction can be defined as <span class="highlight01"> "The number of atoms or molecules which collide together at the same time for the reaction to occur" </span> . Reactions are classified in terms of molecularity as unimolecular, bimolecular, termolecular depending upon the number of molecules involved in the reaction. Example of these reactions are as follows </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Order of Reaction</h4>
		<p>In chemical kinetics the reactions are generally classified in terms of their order. The order of a reaction is defined as <span class="highlight01">"The sum of the concentration terms on which the rate of a reaction actually depends as observed experimentally". </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Zero Order Reactions</h5>
		<p>Reactions in which the concentration of reactants don't change with time and the concentration rates remain constant throughout are said to be zero order reactions. <br />
			Thus, for zero order reactions, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  - \frac{\triangle[R]}{\triangle t} = k  \) </span> or rate = k
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">First Order Reactions</h5>
		<p>The <span class="highlight01"> first order reaction </span> is defined as "The reaction in which the reaction rate is determined by the change of one concentration term of the reactant only", eg, In the reaction <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{ \underset{(a - x)}a}A \rightarrow \underset{ \underset{x}0}B + \underset{ \underset{x}0}C   \) </span>
			<br />
			Suppose initial concentration of A is a mol per litre. Rate constant, k for the first order reaction will be given as <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  k = \frac{2.303}{t}log_{10} \frac{a}{a - x}  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Second Order Reactions</h5>
		<p>The reaction is said to be of <span class="highlight01"> second order </span> if its reaction rate is determined by the variation of two concentration terms of reactants. It can be represented as : <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  - \frac{\triangle R}{\triangle t} \ or \ \frac{\triangle p}{\triangle t} = K[A]^2 \ ( For \ 2A \rightarrow product), \ or \ - \frac{\triangle R}{\triangle t} \ or \ \frac{\triangle p}{\triangle t} = K[A][B] \ ( For \ A + B \rightarrow product)  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Third Order Reactions</h5>
		<p>A reaction is said to be of third order if its rate is determined by the variation of three concentration terms.<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  - \frac{\triangle R}{\triangle t} \ or \ \frac{\triangle p}{\triangle t} = K[A]^3 \ ( For \ 3A \rightarrow product), , \ or \ - \frac{\triangle R}{\triangle t} \ or \ \frac{\triangle p}{\triangle t} = K[A][B][C] \ ( For \ A + B + C \rightarrow product)  \) </span>

<section class="skill" id="04">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Activation energy</h3>
	<p>The activation energy can also be defined as "The energy that activates passive or non-active molecules after its adsorption or minimum energy in excess to normal energy of molecules, which molecules must possess in order to form product on collision. <br />
		The concept of activation energy gives us an idea whether a given reaction is slow or fast at a given temperature. A reaction which has lower activation energy proceed at a faster rate at a given temperature or vice-versa. The differences in activation energy are mainly responsible for observed difference in rates of reactions. The concept of activation energy as applied to chemical reaction can be explained by plotting energy against the progress of reaction as shown in figure below </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Catalyst</h4>
		<p>A catalyst is a substance which alters the reaction rate but itself remain unchanged in amount and chemical composition at the end of the reaction. Actually the reactants in a reaction have to cross an energy barrier to form the product. The higher the energy barrier. the slower is the reaction rate. A catalyst provides a new reaction path with a lower energy barrier. So that more and more reactant molecules can form the product. The same can be seen through the graph given below </p>

			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Chemical kinetics </span> is the study of chemical reactions with respect to reaction rates, effect of various variables, rearrangement of atoms and formation of intermediates. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration of reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can be expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average rate over a large interval of time. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> A number of factors such as temperature, concentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction. Mathematical representation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law. It has to be determined experimentally and cannot be predicted. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Order of a reaction with respect to a reactant is the power of its concentration which appears in the rate law equation. The order of a reaction is the sum of all such powers of concentration of terms for different reactants. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Rate constant is the proportionality factor in the rate law. Rate constant and order of a reaction can be determined from rate law or its integrated rate equation. <span class="highlight01"> Molecularity </span> is defined only for an elementary reaction. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Its values are limited from 1 to 3 whereas order can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or even a fraction. Molecularity and order of an elementary reaction are same. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Temperature dependence of rate constants is described by Arrhenius equation <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left (k = Ae^{\frac{-E_a}{RT}} \right )  \) </span>. <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  E_a  \) </span> corresponds to the <span class="highlight01"> activation energy </span> and is given by the energy difference between activated complex and the reactant molecules, and A (Arrhenius factor or pre-exponential factor) corresponds to the collision frequency. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The equation clearly shows that increase of temperature or lowering of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  E_a  \) </span> will lead to an increase in the rate of reaction and presence of a catalyst lowers the activation energy by providing an alternate path for the reaction. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> According to collision theory, another factor P called steric factor which refers to the orientation of molecules which collide, is important and contributes to effective collisions, thus, modifying the Arrhenius equation to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  =  PZ_{AAB} e^{- \frac{E_a}{RT}}  \) </span>.</p>
