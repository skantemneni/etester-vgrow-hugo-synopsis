		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> d-Block Elements </h4>
		<p> These are the elements in which the differentiating electron (ie, the last electron) enters in the d-subshell, eg, elements of group 3 to 12 (ie, IB to VIIB and VIII). In Periodic Table, they are placed between s- and p-blocks and have properties in between of them, ie, their properties are intermediate between those of s- and p-block elements. That's why, these elements are called <span class="highlight01"> transition elements. </span>

					<p> Zinc, cadmium and mercury, however, because of the presence of completely filled (n - 1) d-subshell in their elementary as well as in combined state, do not show much resemblance with other d-block elements except for their ability to form complexes with ligands such as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  NH_3, RNH_2  \) </span> and halides. Nevertheless, these are studied with the d-block elements in order to maintain a rational classification of elements.

					<p> Elements of II1B group (ie, Sc, Y, La an Ac) also differ in their properties from rest of the member, eg, they form compounds only in +3 oxidation state.

Here, it is obvious that the electronic configuration of these elements differ only in the number of electrons in their penultimate shell (ie, in d-orbital). Thus, they do not show a regular trend of physical and chemical properties like s- and p-block elements. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Atomic radii </span> In a given series, the atomic radii of these elements generally decreases from group 3 to group 10 and after that increases again towards the end of the series. This is because the nuclear charge increases with increase in atomic number. Due to this, the electron clouds are attracted more strongly and results in decreased size. However, the decrease in the radii across the period is not uniform, eg, the radii of elements from Cr to Cu are very close to one another. This is due to the effective screening of outer ns-electrons by the electrons of (n - 1) d subshell. The reason for the anomalous increase in atomic radii towards the end of the series is predominant repulsion between the added electrons. Presence of completely filled d-orbitals also decreases the force of attraction. </p>

These are commonly called lanthanides or lanthanons or rare earths. The name lanthanides or lanthanons was given because they are closely related with lanthanum <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (_{57} Li)  \) </span> in their properties. However, the name rare earth was given because these elements were difficult to obtain. But now this term is obsolete. </p>

		<p> The elements in which last electron enters into f-orbitals of the anti-penultimate (inner to the penultimate shell), ie, (n - 2) shell, are called f-block elements. Since, they constitute transition series within transition series and the last electron occupies the antipenultimate shell, they are named as inner-transition elements. They all belongs to III-B group (3 group) of Periodic Table. In these elements, both the d and f subshells are incomplete.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Werner's Theory </h4>

			The <span class="highlight01"> main postulates </span> of this theory are </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p> Metals possess two types of linkages (valencies) primary or principal linkage and secondary linkage </p>

				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Primary linkages (valencies) are ionisable </span> and are exhibited by a metal in the formation of its simple salts such as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  CoCl_3, CuSO_4 \ and \ AgCl.  \) </span> In these salts, the primary valencies of Co, Cu and Ag are 3, 2 and 1 respectively. Now a days, primary valency is referred to as <span class="highlight01"> oxidation state </span> of the metal ion. </p>

				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Primary linkages (valencies) </span> are satisfied by negative ions while, secondary linkages (valencies) can be satisfied by neutral molecules or negative ions or in some cases positive ions (ligands) also. This happens in case of mixed complexes. </p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Nomenclature of Coordination Compounds </h4>
		<p> The various rules are applied in naming the coordination compounds according to the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) system are </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Order of Naming Ions </h5>
		<p> If the complex compound is ionic, the positive ion (cation) whether simple or complex, is named first followed by the negative ion (anion). eg, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  K[BF_4]  \) </span> ionizes to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  K^+ \ and \ BF_4^-  \) </span> ions. Here cation <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (K^+)  \) </span> is simple and it is named first followed by anionic part. Thus, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  K[BF_4]  \) </span> is named as potassium tetrafluoroborate (III). The complex <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  [Ag(NH_3)_2]Cl  \) </span> ionises as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  [Ag(NH_3)_2]Cl \longrightarrow [Ag(NH_3)_2]^+ + Cl^-  \) </span>
			<br />
			Here, the cation <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  [Ag(NH_3)_2]^+  \) </span> is not a simple one but a complex. Therefore, it is named first and then the anionic part. Thus, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  [Ag(NH_3)_2]Cl  \) </span> is named as diamminesilver (I) chloride. But one word name is given to non-ionic and molecular complexes. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Isomerism </h4>
		<p> It is a phenomenon, in which compounds have the same molecular formula but different physical and chemical properties on account of different structures. These compounds are called <span class="highlight01"> isomers. </span> The complexes in which ligands undergo rapid displacement by other ligands, cannot exhibit isomerism as the arrangement is not stable. Such complexes are known as <span class="highlight01"> labile complexes. </span>
		</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Valence Bond Theory </h4>
		<p> This was evolved largely through the efforts of <span class="highlight01"> Linus Pauling </span> based on attempted Lewis-Sidgwick ideas of the coordinate covalent bond. In this approach, the basic assumption made is that the metal ligand bonds arise by way of donation of pairs of electron from ligands to the metal ie, through forming the coordinate covalent bond. In order to accommodate these electrons, the metal ion must possess requisite number of vacant orbitals of similar energy. These metal orbitals undergo hybridisation to give a set of hybrid orbitals of equal energy with the approach of the ligands. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Crystal Field Theory (CFT) </h4>
		<p> The <span class="highlight01"> crystal field theory </span> was developed by <span class="highlight01"> H. Bethe and V. Vleck </span> (1935) and proved to be more successful in explaining the bonding and properties of coordination complexes. <span class="highlight01"> The theory is based upon the fact that the degenerate (meaning energetically alike) d-orbitals of metal ions are splitted energy wise due to the concentration of point charges in certain specific positions. This is seen because the energy of the orbitals lying in the direction of point charges increases more in comparison to orbitals lying in between the point charges as the electrons in former case experience greater repulsion than in latter case. </span> Thus, energy wise, two groups of orbitals are seen now one with higher energy and other with lower energy. This splitting of 5 degenerate orbitals of metal ion into sets of orbitals having different energies is called <span class="highlight01"> crystal field splitting.</span> In case of octahedral complexes, eg, set <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (d_{x^2 - y^2}, d_{z^2})  \) </span> is of higher energy while in case of tetrahedral complexes <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  t_{2g} \ set \ (d_{xy}, d_{yz}, d_{zx})  \) </span> has higher energy. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Applications of Coordination Compounds </h4>
		<p> Some important applications of coordination compounds are </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Estimation of Hardness of Water </h5>
		<p> EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and forms complex with various metal ions. This is used in the estimation of hardness of water by a volumetric method. Hardness of water is due to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Ca^{2+} \ and \ Mg^{2+}  \) </span> ions. Since, stability constant values of EDTA complex with <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Ca^{2+} \ and \ Mg^{2+} \ are \ 10^7 \ and \ 10^8  \) </span> respectively, it helps the selective estimation of different ions. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Animal and Plant World </h5>
		<p> Cyclic ligands impart extra stability to coordinate compounds. Thus, Mg in chlorophyll and iron in haemoglobin are stable towards dissociation due to the formation of coordination compounds. Haemoglobin of the blood gets oxygenated through the binding of di-oxygen, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  O_2  \) </span> to the ferrous ions in haemoglobin. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> Electroplating of Metals </h5>
		<p> Coordination compounds are used in electroplating industry eg, gold and silver are electroplated from their coordination compounds, such as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  K[Ag(CN)_2] \ or \ K[Au(CN)_4]  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> In Chemotherapy </h5>
		<p> Platinum complex, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  cis \ [PtCl_2(NH_3)_2]  \) </span> called cis-platin is used in cancer chemotherapy. Vitamin <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  B_{12}  \) </span> is a coordination compound of cobalt and is essential to prevent anaemia. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading"> As Catalysts </h5>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<p> The <span class="highlight01"> d-block </span> consisting of Groups 3-12 occupies the large middle section of the periodic table. In these elements the inner d orbitals are progressively filled. The <span class="highlight01"> f-block </span> is placed outside at the bottom of the periodic table and in the elements of this block, 4f and 5f orbitals are progressively filled. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Corresponding to the filling of 3d, 4d and 5d orbitals, three series of transition elements are well recognised. All the transition elements exhibit typical metallic properties such as -high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, thermal and electrical conductivity and metallic character.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Their melting and boiling points are high which are attributed to the involvement of (n  - 1) d electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding. In many of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which indicates that one unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly a favourable configuration for strong interatomic interaction. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> Successive ionisation enthalpies </span>  do not increase as steeply as in the main group elements with increasing atomic number. Hence, the loss of variable number of electrons from (n  - 1) d orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of (n - 1) d electrons in the behaviour of transition elements impart certain distinct characteristics to these elements. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Thus, in addition to variable oxidation states, they exhibit paramagnetic behaviour, catalytic properties and tendency for the formation of coloured ions, interstitial compounds and complexes. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The  <span class="highlight01"> transition elements </span> vary widely in their chemical behaviour. Many of them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are 'noble'. Of the first series, with the exception of copper, all the metals are relatively reactive. <br />
					The transition metals react with a number of non-metals like oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and halogens to form binary compounds. The first series transition metal oxides are generally formed from the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> These oxides dissolve in acids and bases to form oxometallic salts. Potassium dichromate and potassium permanganate are common examples. Potassium dichromate is prepared from the chromite ore by fusion with alkali in presence of air and acidifying the extract. Pyrolusite ore <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (MnO_2)  \) </span> is used for the preparation of potassium permanganate. Both the dichromate and the permanganate ions are strong oxidising agents. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The <span class="highlight01">two series of inner transition elements </span>, <span class="highlight01"> lanthanoids </span>  and <span class="highlight01"> actinoids </span>  constitute the <span class="highlight01"> f-block </span>  of the periodic table. With the successive filling of the inner orbitals, 4f, there is a gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic sizes of these metals along the series (lanthanoid contraction). This has far reacting consequences in the chemistry of the elements succeeding them. Lanthanum and all the lanthanoids are rather soft white metals. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> They react easily with water to give solutions giving +3 ions. The principal oxidation state is +3, although +4 and +2 oxidation states are also exhibited by some occasionally. The chemistry of the <span class="highlight01"> actinoids </span>  is more complex in view of their ability to exist in different oxidation states. Furthermore, many of the actinoid elements are radioactive which make the study of these elements rather difficult.</p>

			<li>
				<p> The <span class="highlight01"> chemistry of coordination compounds </span>  is an important and challenging area of modern inorganic chemistry. During the last fifty years, advances in this area, have provided development of new concepts and models of bonding and molecular structure, novel breakthroughs in <span class="highlight01"> chemical industry </span> and vital insights into the functioning of critical components of <span class="highlight01"> biological systems </span>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The first systematic attempt at explaining the formation, reactions, structure and bonding of a coordination compound was made by A. <span class="highlight01"> Werner </span>. His theory postulated the use of two types of <span class="highlight01"> linkages (primary and secondary) </span> by a metal atom/ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry these linkages are recognised as the ionisable (ionic) and non-ionisable (covalent) bonds, respectively. Using the property of isomerism, Werner predicted the geometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> The Valence Bond Theory (VBT) </span>  explains with reasonable success, the formation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds. It, however, fails to provide a quantitative interpretation of magnetic behaviour and has nothing to say about the optical properties of these compounds. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> The Crystal Field Theory (CFT) </span> to coordination compounds is based on the effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges), on the degeneracy of d orbital energies of the central metal atom/ion. The splitting of the d orbitals provides different electronic arrangements in strong and weak crystal fields. The treatment provides for quantitative estimations of orbital separation energies, magnetic moments and spectral and stability parameters. However, the assumption that ligands consititute point charges creates many theoretical difficulties. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The metal-carbon bond in metal carbonyls possesses both <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sigma  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \pi  \) </span> character. The ligand to metal is  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sigma  \) </span> bond and metal to ligand is  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \pi  \) </span> bond. This unique synergic bonding provides stability to metal carbonyls. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The stability of coordination compounds is measured in terms of <span class="highlight01"> stepwise stability (or formation) constant (K) or overall stability constant  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (\beta)  \) </span>
					</span>. The stabilisation of coordination compound due to chelation is called the chelate effect. The stability of coordination compounds is related to Gibbs energy, enthalpy and entropy terms.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Coordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds provide critical insights into the functioning and structures of vital components of biological systems. Coordination compounds also find extensive applications in <span class="highlight01"> metallurgical processes, analytical and medicinal chemistry </span>.</p>

		<p>What is meant by 'disproportionation' of an oxidation state? Give an example.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Solution</span>
			<br />
			When a particular oxidation state becomes less stable relative to other oxidation states, one lower, one higher, it is said to undergo disproportionation. <br />
			For example, manganese (VI) becomes unstable relative to manganese(VII) and manganese (IV) in acidic solution. <br />

		<p>Why is geometrical isomerism not possible in tetrahedral complexes having two different types of unidentate ligands coordinated with the central metal ion?<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Solution</span>
			<br />
			Tetrahedral complexes do not show geometrical isomerism because the relative positions of the unidentate ligands attached to the central metal atom are the same with respect to each other.</p>

			<span class="highlight01"> Solution</span>
			<br />
			Since the coordination number of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Mn^{2+}  \) </span> ion in the complex ion is 4, it will be either tetrahedral (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  sp^3  \) </span> hybridisation) or square planar (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  dsp^2  \) </span>  hybridisation).<br />
			But the fact that the magnetic moment of the complex ion is 5.9 BM, it should be tetrahedral in shape rather than square planar because of the presence of five unpaired electrons in the d orbitals.</p>
