	<h3 class="skill-heading"> Structure of cyanides and isocyanides </h3>
	<p> Cyanides and isocyanides are isomeric compounds. Both of these are derivatives of HCN which is known to exist in two isomeri forms, eg, <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H - C \equiv N \leftrightharpoons H - N \equiv C  \) </span>
		<br />
		Thus, the general formula for cyanide and isocyanides are <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R - C \equiv N  \ and \ R - N \equiv C  \) </span>
		<br />
		(where, R = alkyl or aryl group) </p>
