		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Modern Periodic Law </h4>
		<p> Moseley, while working in Rutherford's team in 1913, studied the wavelength of the characteristic X-rays by using different metals as anticathode and showed that the square root of the frequency of a line (of X-ray spectrum) is related to the atomic number, Z of the target material as <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sqrt{v} = a(Z - b)  \) </span>
			<br />
			where, a = proportionality constant <br />
			b = another constant (It has same value for all the lines of X-rays spectrum) <br />
			Z = atomic number. <br />
			Thus, Moseley proposed a modified periodic law, according to which, it is the atomic number, and not the atomic weight on which the properties of elements depend. Or in other words, <span class="highlight01"> "The physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic function of their atomic numbers." </span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Long Form Of Periodic Table </h4>
		<p> The Modern Periodic Table was further modified to extended form or long form of Periodic Table. This modification was not done by a single person, but it incorporates the modifications by many scientists especially <span class="highlight01"> Rang, Werner, ohr, Bury etc. </span>
			<br />
			This table is just graphical representation of <span class="highlight01"> aufbau principle </span> . The electronic configuration based classification of elements was given by Bohr that's why the table is also called <span class="highlight01"> Bohr's Periodic Table </span>.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Nomenclature Of The Elements </h4>
		<p> CNIC (Commission on Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry) appointed by IUPAC in 1994, approved official names for elements with atomic number 104 to 109. For the elements having Z &gt; 109, IUPAC recommended a nomenclature to be followed for naming these elements until their names are officially recognised. This nomenclature is based on the Latin words for the atomic numbers of the elements. <br />
			Very recently, on August 16, 2003, IUPAC approved the name for the element of atomic number 110, as Darmstadtium, with symbol Ds. <br />
			The names are derived by using roots for the three digits in the atomic number of the elements and adding the ending -ium. The roots for the numbers are as

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> s - block elements </h4>
		<p>  The s-block elements are present on the extreme left in the Periodic Table. All of these are highly reactive metals except hydrogen. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> p-block elements </h4>
		<p> The p-block elements are present in the right portion of Periodic Table. A clear demarcation line separates the metals and non-metals here. Semi-metals are present along the sides of line. This line begins from B, runs in a zig-zag manner and terminates at <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P_o  \) </span>.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Transitional elements </h4>
		<p>The elements having incompletely filled d- orbitals in the ground state or in excited or chemically combined state are called transitional elements (T-families) or d-block elements. All the elements of d-block are present in the middle portion-of Periodic Table, in between the s and p-block elements and are all metals. </p>

		<p>The inner-transition elements or f-block elements have their (n - 2)f orbitals incompletely filled. There are 2 series of inner
			transition elements, namely, 4f and 5f series. The 4f series begins with cerium (Z = 58) and ends on lutetium (Z = 71) and the 5f series contains elements from thorium (Z = 90) to lawrencium (Z = 103).
