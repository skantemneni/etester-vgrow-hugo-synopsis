	<p> The state of reversible reactions in which the conecentration of the reactants and products do not change with time is known as chemical equilibrium. <br />
		At equilibrium state, Rate of forward reaction = Rate of backward reaction. This can be seen in a graphical mode as : </p>

	 </div>
	<p> Further more, the true equilibrium of a reaction can be attained from both the sides, ie, the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products will always be the same whether we begin with the reactants or the products. <br />
		The variation of concentration of reactants and products in a reversible reaction can be seen as: </p>

	 </div>
	<p> The equilibrium state is dynamic and not static in nature. It means that the reaction does not stop but both the opposing reactions are going on continuously with same speeds. At this state, the number of moles of substances produced per second in the forward reaction is equal to the number of moles of substances which disappear per second in the backward direction. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Law of Mass Action - Equilibrium constant, Application of Equilibrium constant </h3>
	<p> Two Norwegian chemists, Guldberg and Waage studied experimentally a large number of equilibrium reactions in 1864 and postulated a generalisation, called law of mass action according to which, "The rate at which a substance reacts is directly proportional to its active mass and the rate at which a chemical reaction proceeds is proportional to the product of active masses of reacting substances." </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading"> Le-Chatelier's Principle, Acid and Base theories </h3>
	<p> In 1884. French chemist Henry Le-Chatelier proposed a general principle which applies to all systems in equilibrium. The principle commonly called Le-Chatelier's principle and states that. When a change is brought about on a system in equilibrium, the system tends to adjust itself to reduce the effect of change. <br />
		or Le-Chatelier's principle can also be stated as if a system in equilibrium is subjected to a change of concentration, pressure or temperature, the equilibrium shift in the direction that tends to undo the effect of the change. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Acid and Bases </h4>
		<p> The earlier criteria for acids and bases were the .xperimentally observed properties of aqueous solutions. An acid s that whose aqueous solution tastes sour, turns blue litmus red, neutralises bases and so on. On the other hand, the aqueous solution of a base tastes bitter, turns red litmus blue, neutralises acid and so on. Later on some concepts are given to signify acids and bases. These are : </p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Arrhenius Concept </h4>
		<p> According to this concept, all substances, which give <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H^+  \) </span> ions in their aqueous solutions are called acids, while those, which furnish <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  OH^-  \) </span> ions in water are called bases. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  HA	\leftrightharpoons H^+ + A^- (acid)  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  BOH \leftrightharpoons B^+ + OH^- (base)  \) </span>
			<br />
			The strength of the acid or base depends upon its tendency to furnish <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H^+  \) </span> or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  OH^-  \) </span> ions in solution. <br />
			Water is amphoteric because it furnish both <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H^+  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  OH^-  \) </span> ions in solution. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O \leftrightharpoons H^+ + OH^-  \) </span>
			<br />
			Number of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H^+  \) </span> delivered by an acid in its aqueous solution is called basicity or protocity of the acid. The acids are referred to as monobasic, dibasic, tribasic etc according as the number of protons given in aqueous solution are one, two or three. <br />
			Similarly, the number of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  OH^-  \) </span> furnished by the base in its aqueous solution is called its acidity. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Bronsted-Lowry Concept </h4>
		<p> According to this concept, an acid is a substance (molecule or ion) that can donate <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H^+  \) </span> to some other substance and a base is a substance that can accept a proton from an acid. Thus, an acid is a proton donor (protogenic) and a base is proton acceptor (protophilic) </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Lewis Concepts </h4>
		<p> According to this concept, A base is defined as a substance, which can give a pair of electrons to form a co-ordinate bond and the acid is the substance which can accept the pair. Thus, an acid is an electrophile, while a base is a nucleophile. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) Principle </h4>
		<p> "Hardness" is the property of retaining valence electrons very strongly. It is the basis of this principle. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Hard bases </span> Hard acids are characterised by small size of electron accepting atom. They have high charge and have no electron which are easily polarised or removed. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Examples </span> of hard acids are <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H^+, \ Li^+, \ Na^+, ...., Be^{2+}, \ Mg^{2+},......, Mn^{2+}, \ Al^{3+}, \ Cr^{3+}, \ Co^{3+}, \ Fe^{3+}, \ La^{3+}, \ Ce^{3+}, \ As^{3+}, \ BF_3, \ AlCl_3, \ SO_3 \ etc.  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Soft bases </span> Acceptor atom is large, carries low charge, has electrons which can be easily distorted. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Examples </span> of soft acids are <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Pb^{2+}, \ Cd^{2+}, \ Pt^{3+}, \ Hg^{2+}, \ Cd^{2+}, \ Hg^{2+}, \ Cu^+, \ Ag^+, \ Tl^+, \ Hg^{2+}, \ GaCl_3, \ B_2H_6, \ RO^+, \ I_2, \ Br_2  \) </span> metal atoms etc <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Hard bases </span> These are the Lewis base that hold electrons strongly, eg, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  H_2O, \ NH_3, \ OH^-, \ F^-, \ Cl^-, \ CO_3^{2-}, \ ClO_4^-, \ NO_3^-, \ ROH, \ RO^-, \ R_2O, \ RNH_2 \ etc.  \) </span>
