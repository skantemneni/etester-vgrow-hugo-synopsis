		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Analgesics</h4>
		<p>The medicines which are used to reduce pain are known as analgesics. In simple words, we can say, analgesic is the medical name for pain killers. These can be further of two types :</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Non-narcotic (or non-addictive) analgesics </span> The non-habit forming chemicals which are used to reduce mild to moderate pain such as headache, toothache, muscle and joint pain etc are called non-narcotic analgesics.<br />
						Because of their non-habit forming nature, they are also termed as non-addictive. These drugs do not produce sleep and unconsciousness. Some examples of non-narcotic analgesics are ibuprofen, paracetamol, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid etc.<br />
						<div class="synopsis-image">

						 </div>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Narcotic (or addictive) analgesics </span> The pain relieving drugs which proudce sleep and unconsciousness are called narcotic analgescis. Unlike non-naroctic analgesics, these are habit forming.<br />
						These are more effective than non-narcotic drugs. These are mostly opium derivatives and used only in severe pain, eg, morphine, codeine, meperidine, heroin (or morphine diacetate obtained by acetylation of morphine) etc.<br />

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Antipyretics</h4>
		<p>The chemical substances which are used to bring down body temperature during high fever are called antipyretics. eg, paracetamol, aspirin, phenacetin (4-ethoxy acetanilide), analgin, novalgin etc.<br />
			Out of these, paracetamol is the most popular antipyretics.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Tranquillizers</h4>
		<p>The chemical compounds which are used for the treatment of stress, mild and severe mental diseases are known as tranquillizers.<br />
			They induce the sense of fitness and relieve stress and fatigue. Therefore, these drugs are also known as <span class="highlight01"> psychotherapeutic drugs </span> They form an essential part of sleeping pills.
		</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Sedatives </span> These act as depressant and suppress the activities of central nervous system. These are given to mentally agitated and violent patients.<br />
						Sedatives give a feeling of calmness, relaxation or drowsiness in the body, eg, valium, barbiturates, diazepam etc.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Antidepressants </span> These drugs are given to persons with shattered confidence. These drugs act on central nervous system and produce a feeling of well being and confidence in the person of depressed mood.<br />
						That's why these are also termed as mood booster drugs. eg, vitalin, benzedrine, tofranil, methedrine and cocaine etc.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Hypnotics </span> These are used to reduce mental tension and anxiety, eg, chloretone, luminal and seconal etc.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Psychedic drugs </span> They produce hallucination, disturb vision and hearing and cause false feeling of happiness. An example of powerful psychedlic drug is LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide).<br />
						Other example of such drugs is mescaline.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Antiseptics and Disinfectants</h4>
		<p> The chemicals which either prevent the growth of micro-organisms or kill them but are not harmful to the living tissues, are known as antiseptics. Being harmless to living tissues, antiseptics can be safely applied on wounds, ulcers, cuts and diseased skin surfaces.<br />
			These drugs also reduce odours caused by bacterial decomposition on the body or in the mouth. These are, therefore, mixed with body deodorants, face powders and breath purifiers, eg, Bithional, an antiseptic, is mixed to medicated soaps to impart antiseptic properties.</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Antimicrobials</h4>
		<p>The chemicals which are used to cure infections caused by microbes (microorganims) either by killing or destroying them, are known as antimicrobials. Microbes are extremely small Organisms that can be seen through microscope only, eg, bacteria, viruses etc.<br />
			The microbes which produce diseases / infections are known as <span class="highlight01"> pathogens.</span>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Antifertility Drugs</h4>
		<p>The chemicals which are used to check pregnancy in woman are known as antifertility drugs. These are also known as <span class="highlight01"> birth control pills </span> or <span class="highlight01"> oral contracetptives. </span>
			<br />
			The basic aim of these drugs is to prevent conception or fertilization.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Preservatives</h4>
		<p>During the storage and distribution of food, several undesirable changes occur in flavour, colour, texture and appetitic appeal. To avoid these changes some chemicals are added to food. These chemicals are known as preservatives.<br />
			In other words the chemicals which are used to protect food from microbes actions, ie, which arrest the process of fermentation.<br />
			acidification and any other decomposition of food are known as food preservatives. Some important examples of food preservatives are given below :
		</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Carboxylates </span> such as sodium benzoate <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (C_6 H_5 COONa)  \) </span> are commonly used to preserve food. Sodium benzoate is used as preservative in soft drinks and acidic foods. <br />
						It is metabolised by conversion to hippuric acid <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (C_6 H_5 CONHCH_2 COOH)  \) </span> which is ultimately excereted with urine. Sodium and calcium propionates are used as preservatives in breads and cakes.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Vitamin E </span> is naturally occurring food preservative found in vegetable oil.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The jams and squashes-pickles are preserved by adding sodium metabisulphite <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (Na_2 S_2 O_5)  \) </span> or potassium metabisulphite, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  K_2 S_2 O_5  \) </span>. The sulphurous acid present in it inhibit the growth of microbes. <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  Na_2 S_2 O_5 \rightarrow Na_2 SO_3 + SO_2  \\\\[3pt]
							SO_2 + H_2O \rightarrow H_2 SO_3  \end{align}  \) </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In cheese, baked food, pickles and meat, sorbic acid and its salts are used as preservative.</p>
				</li>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Artificial Sweetening Agents</h4>
		<p>chemicals which are not sugars (crbohydrates) but give sweetening effect to the food and ehance its odour and flavour are called artificial sweetening agents.<br />
			Important artificial sweeteners are :
		</p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Saccharin </span> It is the first discovered artificial sweetener. It is very popular sweetening agent. It is about 300 times sweeter than cane sugar. It is non-biodegradable compound but has no calorific value.<br />
						In market, it is available in the form of its sodium or calcium salt as these are water soluble. Saccharin has proved to be a life saver for countless diabetics and is of great value to people who need to control intake of calories.<br />
						<div class="synopsis-image"> 
							<img src="103202015_image-4.png" alt="image4" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Aspartame </span> It is an another artificial sweetener. It is methyl ester of the dipeptide obtained from phenylalanine and aspartic acid. It's structure is <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  HOOC - \underset{aspartame}{CH_2} - {\overset{ \overset{NH_2} |} CH} -  - \overset{ \overset{O} ||}{C} - NH{\overset{ \overset{COOCH_3} |} C} HCH_2C_6H_5  \) </span>
						<br />
						It is also known as "Nutra sweet". It is about 180 times sweeter than cane sugar. The only limitation for it is that at baking or higher temperatures, it gets decomposed, so its use is limited only in cold foods and soft drinks.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Alitame </span> It is more stable than aspartame at high temperature. it is about 2000 times sweeeter than sucrose.<br />
						<div class="synopsis-image">

						 </div>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Sucralose </span> It is a trichloro derivative of sucrose. it is about 650 times sweeter than cane sugar. It is a zero calorie sugar.<br />
						<div class="synopsis-image"> 
							<img src="103202015_image-6.png" alt="image6" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
						 </div>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Cyclamate </span> It is also an artificial sweetener. Chemically, it is N-cyclohexylsulphamate. It is only twenty times sweeter than cane sugar <br />

				<p> Chemistry is essentially the study of materials and the development of new materials for the betterment of humanity. A drug is a chemical agent, which affects human metabolism and provides cure from ailment. If taken in doses higher than recommended, these may have poisonous effect. Use of chemicals for therapeutic effect is called chemotherapy.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Drugs usually interact with biological macromolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. These are called target molecules. Drugs are designed to interact with specific targets so that these have the least chance of affecting other targets. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> This minimises the side effects and localises the action of the drug. Drug chemistry centres around arresting microbes/destroying microbes, preventing the body from various infectious diseases, releasing mental stress, etc. Thus, drugs like analgesics, antibiotics, antiseptics, disinfectants, antacids and tranquilizers are used for specific purpose. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> To check the population explosion, antifertility drugs have also become prominent in our life. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> Food additives such as preservatives, sweetening agents, flavours, antioxidants, edible colours and nutritional supplements </span>  are added to the food to make it attractive, palatable and add nutritive value. Preservatives are added to the food to prevent spoilage due to microbial growth. Artificial sweeteners are used by those who need to check the calorie intake or are diabetic and want to avoid taking sucrose.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> These days, detergents are much in vogue and get preference over soaps because they work even in hard water. Synthetic detergents are classified into three main categories, namely: <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  anionic, cationic and non-ionic  \) </span> , and each category has its specific uses. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Detergents with straight chain of hydrocarbons are preferred over branched chain as the latter are <span class="highlight01"> non-biodegradable </span> and consequently cause  <span class="highlight01"> environmental pollution </span>.</p>
