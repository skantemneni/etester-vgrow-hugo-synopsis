		<p> When two light waves of exactly equal frequency having phase difference which is constant with respect to time travelled in same direction and overlap each other, then intensity is not uniform in space. <br />
			At some points the intensity of light is maximum (more than the sum of individual intensities of those waves), while at some points the intensity of light is minimum (less than the difference of individual intensities of those waves). <br />
			Thus, formation of maximum intensity at some points and minimum intensity at some other points by the two identical light waves travelling in same direction is called the interference of light. <br />
			The interference at the points where the two waves meet in same phase, ie, the intensity of light is maximum, is called the <span class="highlight01"> constructive interference </span> while at the points where the two wayes meet in opposite phase, ie, the intensity of light is minimum is called the <span class="highlight01"> destructive interference </span> .</p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Doppler's Effect in Light</h4>
		<p> The phenomenon of apparent change in freqtiency (or wavelength) of the light due to the relative motion between the source of light and the observer is called Doppler's effect in light. <br />
			When the source of light and the observer approach each other, the frequency of the light appears to be more than the actual frequency of the light emitted from the source (or the wavelength of the light appears to be lesser than the actuial wavelength). On the other hand, when the source of light and the observer recede from each other, the apparent frequency of the light decreases or the apparent wavelength increases. The change in frequency (or the wavelength) of the light for the given relative velocity of the source and the observer is independent of the fact, whether the source is in motion or the observer is in motion. <br />
			Consider that a source of light emits light waves of frequency v and wavelength <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \lambda  \) </span>. If the light travels with velocity c. then <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  c = v \lambda  \) </span>
			<br />
			A stationary observer will receive v waves per second. In case, the observer moves towards the source of light with velocity v along the direction of propagation of light, then the number of waves received per second ie, apparent frequency of light will be <br />
			v' = v + number of waves contained in distance equal to v<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  = v + \frac{v}{\lambda} = v + \frac{v}{c/v} \ \ \ \ \ \left ( \because \lambda = \frac{c}{v} \right )  \\\\[3pt]
				v' = v \left ( 1 + \frac{v}{c} \right )  \\\\[3pt]
				or \ v' = v \left ( 1 + \frac{v}{c} \right )  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			It follows that <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v' &gt; v  \) </span> ie, when the source and the observer approach each other, apparent frequency of the light increases. <br />
			When the source of light and the observer move away from each other, then the apparent frequency of light can be obtained from above equation by changing v to -v. Therefore. when the source of light and the observer move away from each other, the apparent frequency of the light is given by <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   v' = v \left ( 1 - \frac{v}{c} \right )  \) </span>
			<br />
			It follows that <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   v' &lt; v   \) </span> ie, the apparent frequency of light decreases, when the source of light and the observer move away from each other. <br />
			For apparent frequency of light may be written in the combined form as <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   v' = v \left ( 1 \pm \frac{v}{c} \right )  \) </span>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Diffraction of Light</h3>
	<p> Diffraction of light is the phenomenon of bending of light aro'lm corners of an obstacle or aperture in the path of light. This bending light penetrates into the geometrical shadow of the obstacle. The light thus deviates from its linear path. This deviation is more effective when the dimensions of the aperture or the obstacle are comparable to the wavelength of light. <br />
		The phenomenon of diffraction is divided mainly in the following two classes</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Polarization Of Light</h3>
	<p> Light is an electromagnetic wave in which electric and magnetic field vectors vary sinusoidally, perpendicular to each other as well as perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave of light. <br />
		The phenomenon of restricting the vibrations of light (electric vector) in a particular direction, perpendicular to the direction of wave motion is called <span class="highlight01"> polarization of light </span>. The tourmaline crystal acts as a <span class="highlight01"> polariser </span>. <br />
		Thus, electromagnetic waves are said to be polarised when their electric field vector are all in a single plane, called the plane of oscillation/vibration. Light waves from common sources are oscillation/vibration. Light waves from common sources are unpolarised or randomly polarised. <br />
		The plane ABCD in which the vibrations of polarised light are confined is called the <span class="highlight01"> plane of vibration </span>. The plane EFGH which is perpendicular to the plane of vibration is defined as the <span class="highlight01">plane of polarization </span>. </p>

				<p>Huygens' principle tells us that each point on a wavefront is a source of secondary waves, which add up to give the wavefront at a later time.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Huygens' construction tells us that the new wavefront is the forward envelope of the secondary waves. When the speed of light is independent of direction, the secondary waves are spherical. The rays are then perpendicular to both the wavefronts and the time of travel is the same measured along any ray. This principle leads to the well known laws of reflection and refraction.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The principle of superposition of waves applies whenever two or more sources of light illuminate the same point. When we consider the intensity of light due to these sources at the given point, there is an interference term in addition to the sum of the individual intensities. But this term is important only if it has a non-zero average, which occurs only if the sources have the same frequency and a stable phase difference.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Young's double slit of separation d gives equally spaced fringes of angular separation <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{λ}{d}  \) </span>. The source, mid-point of the slits, and central bright fringe lie in a straight line. An extended source will destroy the fringes if it subtends angle more than <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{λ}{d}  \) </span> at the slits.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A single slit of width a gives a diffraction pattern with a centralmaximum. The intensity falls to zero at angles of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \pm \frac{\lambda}{a}, \ \pm \frac{2 \lambda}{a}  \) </span>, with successively weaker secondary maxima in between. Diffraction limits the angular resolution of a telescope to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{λ}{d}  \) </span> where D is the diameter. Two stars closer than this give strongly overlapping images. Similarly, a microscope objective subtending angle <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2 \beta \) </span> at the focus, in a medium of refractive index n, will just separate two objects spaced at a distance <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{\lambda}{ (2n \ sin \ \beta)}  \) </span>, which is the resolution limit of a microscope. Diffraction determines the limitations of the concept of light rays. A beam of width a travels a distance <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{a^2}{\lambda}  \) </span>, called the Fresnel distance, before it starts to spread out due to diffraction.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Natural light, e.g., from the sun is unpolarised. This means the electric vector takes all possible directions in the transverse plane, rapidly and randomly, during a measurement. A polaroid transmits only one component (parallel to a special axis). The resulting light is called linearly polarised or plane polarised. When this kind of light is viewed through a second polaroid whose axis turns through <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2 \pi  \) </span>, two maxima and minima of intensity are seen. Polarised light can also be produced by reflection at a special angle (called the Brewster angle) and by scattering through <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{\pi}{2}  \) </span> in the earth’s atmosphere.</p>
