	<h3 class="skill-heading">Reflecting Of Light</h3>
	<p> When a beam of light is incident on a polished interface, it is thrown back in same medium. This phenomenon is called <span class="highlight01"> reflection </span> .<br />
		In reflection the frequency, speed and wavelength do not change, but a phase change may occur depending on the nature of reflecting surface. <br/>
		Experimentally it is found that the rays corresponding to the incident ind reflected waves make equal angles with the normal to the surface. Thus, the two laws of reflection can be summarized as under.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Refraction</h3>
	<p> When light passes from one medium, say air, to another medium, say glass, a part is reflected back into the first medium and the rest passes into the second medium. When it passes into the second medium, it either bends towards the normal or away from the normal. This phenomenon is known as refraction. </p>

			<br />
			You may think that the image will now show only half of the object, but taking the laws of reflection to be true for all points of the remaining part of the mirror, the image will be that of the whole object. However, as the area of the reflecting surface has been reduced, the intensity of the image will be low (in this case, half).</p>

			<br />
			From the mirror equation, we get <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v = \frac{fu}{u - f}  \) </span>
			<br />
			For convex mirror, since R = 2 m, f = 1 m. Then <br />
			for u = - 39 m, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v = \frac{(-39) \times 1}{- 39 - 1} = \frac{39}{40} m  \) </span>
			<br />
			Since the jogger moves at a constant speed of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  5 \ m \ s^{-1}  \) </span>, after 1 s the position of the image v (for u = -39 + 5 = -34) is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( \frac{34}{35} \right )m  \) </span>. The shift in the position of image in 1 s is <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{39}{40} - \frac{34}{35} = \frac{1365 - 1360}{1400} = \frac{5}{1400} = \frac{1}{280} \ m  \) </span>
			<br />
			Therefore, the average speed of the image when the jogger is between 39 m and 34 m from the mirror, is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( \frac{1}{280} \right ) \ m \ s^{-1}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Similarly, it can be seen that for u = -29 m, -19 m and -9 m, the speed with which the image appears to move is <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{150} \ m \ s^{-1}, \ \frac{1}{60} \ m \ s^{-1}\ and \ \frac{1}{10} \ m \ s^{-1}  \) </span>,  respectively. <br />
			Although the jogger has been moving with a constant speed, the speed of his/her image appears to increase substantially as he/she moves closer to the mirror. This phenomenon can be noticed by any person sitting in a stationary car or a bus. In case of moving vehicles, a similar phenomenon could be observed if the vehicle in the rear is moving closer with a constant speed.</p>

				<li>
					<p>Solving as in the previous example, we find that the person should use a concave lens of focal length = - 80 cm, i.e., of power = - 1.25 dioptres.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>No. The concave lens, in fact, reduces the size of the object, but the angle subtended by the distant object at the eye is the same as the angle subtended by the image (at the far point) at the eye. The eye is able to see distant objects not because the corrective lens magnifies the object, but because it brings the object (i.e., it produces virtual image of the object) at the far point of the eye which then can be focussed by the eye-lens on the retina</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The myopic person may have a normal near point, i.e., about 25 cm (or even less). In order to read a book with the spectacles, such a person must keep the book at a distance greater than 25 cm so that the image of the book by the concave lens is produced not closer than 25 cm. The angular size of the book (or its image) at the greater distance is evidently less than the angular size when the book is placed at 25 cm and no spectacles are needed. Hence, the person prefers to remove the spectacles while reading.</p>

						The corrective lens needs to have a converging power of + 2.67 dioptres.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The corrective lens produces a virtual image (at 75 cm) of an object at 25 cm. The angular size of this image is the same as that of the object. In this sense the lens does not magnify the object but merely brings the object to the near point of the hypermetric eye, which then gets focussed on the retina. However, the angular size is greater than that of the same object at the near point (75 cm) viewed without the spectacles. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>A hypermetropic eye may have normal far point i.e., it may have enough converging power to focus parallel rays from infinity on the retina of the shortened eyeball. Wearing spectacles of converging lenses (used for near vision) will amount to more converging power than needed for parallel rays. Hence the person prefers not to use the spectacles for far objects.</p>
