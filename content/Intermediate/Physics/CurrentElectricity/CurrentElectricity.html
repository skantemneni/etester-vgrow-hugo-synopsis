	<p>Electric current is defined as the amount of charge flowing across any section of wire per unit time. If charge <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \Delta p \) </span> passes through the area in time interval <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \Delta t \) </span> at uniform rate, then current i is defined as <br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( i = \frac{ \Delta p}{ \Delta t}.......(i) \) </span>
		<br />
		If rate of flow of charge is not steady then instantaneous current is given by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( i = \lim \limits_{ \Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{ \Delta q}{ \Delta t} = \frac{dq}{dt}...........(ii) \) </span>
		<br />
		The unit of current is ampere (A) is the SI base unit. Smaller currents are more conveniently expressed in milliampere.<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (1 mA = 10^{-3} A) \ or \ microampere \ (1 \mu A = 10^{-6} A) \) </span>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Joule's law</h3>
	<p> Joule's law,  in electricity, mathematical description of the rate at which resistance in a circuit converts electric energy into heat energy. The amount of heat per second that develops in a wire carrying a current is proportional to the electrical resistance of the wire and the square of the current. He determined that the heat evolved per second is equivalent to the electric power absorbed, or the power loss.<br />
		A quantitative form of Joule's law is that the heat evolved per second, or the electric power loss, P, equals the current I squared times the resistance R, or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( P = I^2R \) </span>. The power P has units of watts, or joules per second, when the current is expressed in amperes and the resistance in ohms.</p>

Fig. (a) shows the resistances in series that means one after another. The current is the same in each element.</p>

	 </div>
	<p>The resistors in Fig. (b) are said to be in parallel between the points x and y. Each resistor provides an alternative path between the points. The potential difference is the same across each element. In Fig(c) resistors, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( R_2 \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( R_3 \) </span> are in parallel with each other and this combination is in series with resistance <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( R_1 \) </span>. In Fig.(d), <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( R_2 \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( R_3 \) </span> are in series and this combination is in parallel with <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( R_1 \) </span>.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Equivalent Resistance</h4>
		<p>It is always possible to find a single resistor that could replace a combination of resistors in any given circuit and leave unchanged the potential differences between the terminals of the combination and the current in the rest of the circuit. The resistance of this single resistor is called equivalent resistance of the combination. If any one of the networks were replaced by its equivalent resistance R, we could write<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( V_{xy} = iR \ or \ R = \frac{V_{xy}}{i} \) </span>
			<br />
			where <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( V_{xy} \) </span> is the potential difference between the terminals x and y of the network and i is the current at point x or y. Hence, the method of computing an equivalent resistance is to assume a potential difference <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( V_{xy} \) </span> across the actual network, compute the corresponding current i, and take the ratio <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{V_{xy}}{i} \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class="highlight01">If the resistors are in series</span> as in Fig. (a), current in each one must be the same and equal to the line current i. Hence<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  V_{xa} = iR_1, \ V_{ab} = iR_2 \ and \ V_{by} = iR_3  \\\\[3pt]
				V_{xy} = V_{xa} + V_{ab} + V_{by}  \\\\[3pt]
				= i(R_1 + R_2 + R_3)  \\\\[3pt]
				\frac{V_{xy}}{i} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			But <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{V_{xy}}{i} \) </span>is, by definition, the equivalent resistance R. Therefore, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( R = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 \) </span> The equivalent resistance of any number of resistors in series equals the sum of their individual resistances.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">If the resistors are in parallel</span> as in Fig.(b), the potential difference between the terminals of each must be same and equal to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( V{xy} \) </span>. If the currents in each are denoted by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( i_1, \ i_2 \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( i_3 \) </span> respectively, then <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( i_1 = \frac{V_{xy}}{R_1}, \ i_2 = \frac{V_{xy}}{R_2}, \ i_3 = \frac{V_{xy}}{R_3} \) </span>
			<br />
			Since, charge is not accumulated at x, it follows that<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align} i = i_1 + i_2 + i_3 = V_{xy} \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} \right)  \\\\[3pt]
				or \ \frac{i}{V_{xy}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}  \\\\[3pt]
				But \ \frac{i}{V_{xy}} = \frac{1}{R}, \ so \ that  \\\\[3pt]
				\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			For any number of resistors in parallel, the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance equals to the sum of the reciprocal of their individual resistances.For special case of two resistors in parallel,<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align} \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{R_2 + R_1}{R_1 R_2}  \\\\[3pt]
				and \ R = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			also, since <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( V_{xy} = i_1 R_1 = i_2 R_2  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \Rightarrow \frac{i_1}{i_2} = \frac{R_2}{R_1} \) </span>
			<br />
			and the currents carried by two resistors in parallel are inversely proportional to their resistances. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Ohm's law</h3>
	<p> consider a closed circuit having a source of emf and a conductor. Let the voltage drop across the ends of the conductor be V and let i be the steady current flowing through the conductor. The quantity <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \frac{V}{i} \) </span> is a measure of the resistance offered by the conductor for the steady flow of charge through it. The more the resistance, the less is the current i for a given voltage difference, V.<br />
		For many conductors, it is found experimentally that the ratio <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \frac{V}{i} \) </span> is a constant at constant temperature. the constant is called the resistance of the conductor and is denoted by R. <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \frac{V}{i} = R \ or \ V = iR \) </span>. This relationship is called Ohm's law. <br />
		The constancy of R implies that V and i are linearly related a graph between measured values of V and i is a straight line. The unit of resistance is ohm <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (1 \Omega = 1 VA^{-1}) \) </span>. Ohm's law is only an empirical law that holds approximately for many substances over certain ranges of V and i.</p>

				<p>Current through a given area of a conductor is the net charge passing per unit time through the area.</p>

				<p>To maintain a steady current, we must have a closed circuit in which an external agency moves electric charge from lower to higher potential energy. The work done per unit charge by the source in taking the charge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminal of the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or emf, of the source.

			<span class="highlight01"> Solution </span>
			<br />
			When the current through the element is very small, heating effects can be ignored and the temperature <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   T_1  \) </span> of the element is the same as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to the supply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady value of 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperature will rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slight decrease in current. In a few seconds, a steady state will be reached when temperature will rise no further, and both the resistance of the element and the current drawn will achieve steady values. The resistance <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   R_2  \) </span> at the steady temperature <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   T_2  \) </span> is <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   R_2 = \frac{230 V}{2.68 \ A} = 85.8 \ \Omega  \) </span>

			<br />
			The network is not reducible to a simple series and parallel combinations of resistors. There is, however, a clear symmetry in the problem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance of the network. <br />
			The paths AA', AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in the network. Thus, the current in each must be the same, say, I. Further, at the corners A', B and D, the incoming current I must split equally into the two outgoing branches. In this manner, the current in all the 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of I, using Kirchhoff’s first rule and the symmetry in the problem. Next take a closed loop, say, ABCC'EA, and apply Kirchhoff’s second rule: <br />

			Each branch of the network is assigned an unknown current to be determined by the application of Kirchhoff's rules. To reduce the number of unknowns at the outset, the first rule of Kirchhoff is used at every junction to assign the unknown current in each branch. We then have three unknowns <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I_1, \ I_2 \ and \ I_3  \) </span> which can be found by applying the second rule of Kirchhoff to three different closed loops. Kirchhoff's second rule for the closed loop ADCA gives, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  10 - 4(I_1 - I_2) + 2(I_2 + I_3 - I_1) - I_1 = 0 \ \ \ \  (1)  \\\\[3pt]

				that \ is, \ I_1 + 6I_2 + 2I_3 = 10  \ \ \ \ \ (2)  \\\\[3pt]

			It is easily verified that Kirchhoff’s second rule applied to the remaining closed loops does not provide any additional independent equation, that is, the above values of currents satisfy the second rule for every closed loop of the network.
