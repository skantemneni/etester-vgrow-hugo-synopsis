	<h3 class="skill-heading">Power in an AC Circuit</h3>
	<p> The power is defined as the rate at which work is being done in the circuit. In AC circuit, the current and emf are not necessarily in the same phase. therefore, we write <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V = V_0 sin \omega t, i = i_0 sin( \omega t + \theta)  \) </span>
		<br />
		The instantaneous power <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P = Vi = V_0 sin \omega t, i = i_0 sin(\omega t + \theta)  \) </span>
		<br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P_{av} = V_{rms} i_{rms} cos \theta  \) </span>
		<br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore P_{av} = \frac{V}{\sqrt{2}} \frac{i_0}{\sqrt{2}} cos \theta  \) </span>
		<br />
		where, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  cos \theta = \frac{Resistance (R) is}{impedance (Z)}  \) </span>is called the power factor of AC circuit. <br />
		<span class="highlight01">Note</span>
		<br />
		If <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R = 0, cos \theta = 0 \ and \ P_{av} = 0,  \) </span> i.e, in resistanceless circuit the power loss is zero. Such a circuit is called wattless circuit and the current flowing is called the wattless current. </p>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Transformer</h4>
		<p> Transformer is a device used for converting low alternating voltage at high current into high voltage at low current and vice-versa. <br />
			Principle It works on the principle of mutual induction, ie, if two coils are inductively coupled and when current or magnetic flux is changed through one of the two coils, then induced emf is produced in the other coil. </p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Kinds of Transformer</h4>
		<p> There are two types of transformers: <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Step-up transformer </span> The transformer used to change low voltage alternating emf to high voltage alternating emf (of same frequency) is called a step-up transformer. The current value in output is less than that in input. <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Step-down transformer </span> The transformer used to change high voltage alternating emf to low voltage alternating emf R = 80 Q (of same frequency) is called a step-dope, transformer. The current in output is more than that in input.</p>

			<li>
				<p>An alternating voltage <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v = v_m \ sin \ \omega \ t  \) </span> applied to a resistor R drives a current <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  i = i_m \ sin \ \omega \ t  \) </span> in the resistor <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( i_m = \frac{v_m}{r}  \) </span>.The current is in phase with the applied voltage.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>For an alternating current <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  i = i_m \ sin \omega \ t  \) </span> passing through a resistor R, the average power loss P (averaged over a cycle) due to joule heating is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left( \frac{1}{2} \right ){i_m}^2 \ mR  \) </span>. To express it in the same form as the dc power <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (P = I^2 R)  \) </span>, a special value of current is used. It is called root mean square (rms) current and is donoted by I: <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I = \frac{i_m}{\sqrt{2}} = 0.707 \ i_m   \) </span>
					<br />
					Similarly, the rms voltage is defined by <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  V = \frac{v_m}{\sqrt{2}} = 0.707 \ v_m  \\\\[3pt]
						we \ have \ P = IV = I^2 R  \end{align}  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>An ac voltage <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v = v_m \ sin \ \omega \ t  \) </span> applied to a pure inductor L, drives a current in the inductor <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  i = i_m \ sin \left (\omega \ t - \frac{\pi}{2} \right )  \) </span>, where <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  i_m = \frac{v_m}{X_L}. X_L = \omega \ L  \) </span> is called inductive reactance. The current in the inductor lags the voltage by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{\pi}{2}  \) </span>. The average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycle is zero.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>An ac voltage v = vm sinωt applied to a capacitor drives a current in the capacitor: <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  i = i_m \ sin \left (\omega t + \frac{\pi}{2} \right )  \) </span>. Here, <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  i_m = \frac{v_m}{X_C}, \ X_C = \frac{1}{\omega \ C}  \) </span>
					<br />
					is called capacitive reactance. <br />
					The current through the capacitor is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{\pi}{2}  \) </span> ahead of the applied voltage. As in the case of inductor, the average power supplied to a capacitor over one complete cycle is zero.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>For a series RLC circuit driven by voltage <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v = v_m  \) </span>, the current is given by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  i = i_m \ sin (\omega t + \phi)  \) </span>
					<br />
					where <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  i_m = \frac{v_m}{ \sqrt{R^2 + (X_C - X_L)^2}}  \\\\[3pt]
						and \ \phi = tan^{-1} \frac{X_C - X_L}{R}  \\\\[3pt]
						Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (X_C - X_L)^2}  \end{align}  \) </span> is called the impedance of the circuit. <br />
					The average power loss over a complete cycle is given by <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P = VI \ cos \ \phi  \) </span>
					<br />
					The term cosφ is called the power factor.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In a purely inductive or capacitive circuit,  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   cos \ \phi = 0  \) </span> and no power is dissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit. In such cases, current is referred to as a wattless current.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The phase relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuit can be shown conveniently by representing voltage and current by rotating vectors called phasors. A phasor is a vector which rotates about the origin with angular speed <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \omega  \) </span>. The magnitude of a phasor represents the amplitude or peak value of the quantity (voltage or current) represented by the phasor. <br />
					The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor diagram.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>An interesting characteristic of a series RLC circuit is the phenomenon of resonance. The circuit exhibits resonance, i.e., the amplitude of the current is maximum at the resonant frequency, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}  \) </span>, The quality factor Q defined by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Q = \frac{\omega_0 \ L}{R} = \frac{1}{\omega_0 \ C R}   \) </span> is an indicator of the sharpness of the resonance, the higher value of Q indicating sharper peak in the current.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A circuit containing an inductor L and a capacitor C (initially charged) with no ac source and no resistors exhibits free oscillations. The charge q of the capacitor satisfies the equation of simple harmonic motion: <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{d^2 q}{dt^2}+ \frac{1}{LC} q = 0  \) </span>
					<br />
					and therefore, the frequency ω of free oscillation is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}  \) </span> The energy in the system oscillates between the capacitor and the inductor but their sum or the total energy is constant in time.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A transformer consists of an iron core on which are bound a primary coil of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  N_p  \) </span> turns and a secondary coil of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   N_s  \) </span> turns. If the primary coil is connected to an ac source, the primary and secondary voltages are related by <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   V_s = \left ( \frac{N_s}{N_p} \right ) V_p  \) </span>
					<br />
					and the currents are related by <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I_s = \left ( \frac{N_p}{N_s} \right ) I_p  \) </span>
					<br />
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the primary, the voltage is stepped-up <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (V_s &gt; V_p)  \) </span>. This type of arrangement is called a stepup transformer. If the secondary coil has turns less than the primary, we have a step-down transformer.</p>

		<p>A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predict your observations for dc and ac connections. What happens in each case if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced?<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Solution </span>
			<br />
			When a dc source is connected to a capacitor, the capacitor gets charged and after charging no current flows in the circuit and the lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if C is reduced. With ac source, the capacitor offers capacitative reactance <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left (\frac{1}{\omega \ C} \right)  \) </span> and the current flows in the circuit.

		<p>
			<span class="highlight01"> Solution </span>
			<br />
			As the iron rod is inserted, the magnetic field inside the coil magnetizes the iron increasing the magnetic field inside it. Hence, the inductance of the coil increases. Consequently, the inductive reactance of the coil increases. As a result, a larger fraction of the applied ac voltage appears across the inductor, leaving less voltage across the bulb. Therefore, the glow of the light bulb decreases.</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 7:</h4>
		<p>At an airport, a person is made to walk through the doorway of a metal detector, for security reasons. If she/he is carrying anything made of metal, the metal detector emits a sound. On what principle does this detector work?<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Solution </span>
			<br />
			The metal detector works on the principle of resonance in ac circuits. When you walk through a metal detector, you are, in fact, walking through a coil of many turns. The coil is connected to a capacitor tuned so that the circuit is in resonance. When you walk through with metal in your pocket, the impedance of the circuit changes - resulting in significant change in current in the circuit. This change in current is detected and the electronic circuitry causes a sound to be emitted as an alarm.</p>
