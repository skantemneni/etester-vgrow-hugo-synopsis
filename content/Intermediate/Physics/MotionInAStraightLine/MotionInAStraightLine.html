		<br />
		Distance and Displacement can never be equal, since distance is a scalar quantity and displacement is a vector quantity. However, distance and displacement can be equal in magnitude in a particular case of a body executing translatory motion.

		 </div>
		<p> For a body traversing a straight path in the same direction, we assume the direction in which the body is moving to be positive. Therefore, we always obtain the displacement with a postive sign. In such cases, the distance travelled by the body would be equal to the magnitude of displacement of the body.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Same Displacement &gt; &gt; Different Distances </span>
			<br />
			Considering the motion of a body along a straight line path displacement and distance can have the same magnitude only under one condition i.e. in case of a body traversing a linear path and moving in one direction. In any other case, displacement and distance travelled would not be the same. <br />
			Where the body is in the same location on a number of occassions during its journey, its displacement would be the same everytime it is located at that position. This is because, displacement takes into consideration the location (final and initial) of the body only and not the journey the body made to reach the final location.

				<p>An object is said to be in motion if its position changes with time. The position of the object can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin. For motion in a straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as negative.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Path length is defined as the total length of the path traversed by an object.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Displacement is the change in position : <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \triangle{x} = x_2 - x_1  \) </span>. Path length is greater or equal to the magnitude of the displacement between the same points.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>An object is said to be in  uniform motion   in a straight line if its displacement is equal in equal intervals of time. Otherwise, the motion is said to be   non-uniform  .</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Average velocity   is the displacement divided by the time interval in which the displacement occurs : <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \overline{v} = \frac{\triangle{x}}{\triangle{t}}  \) </span>
					<br />
					On an x-t graph, the average velocity over a time interval is the slope of the line connecting the initial and final positions corresponding to that interval.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Average Speed is the ratio of total path length traversed and the corresponding time interval. <br />
					The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Instantaneous velocity   or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \triangle{t}  \) </span> becomes infinitesimally small : <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v = \lim \limits_{\triangle{t} \rightarrow 0} \overline{v} = \lim \limits_{\triangle{t} \rightarrow 0} \frac{\triangle{x}}{\triangle{t}} = \frac{dx}{dt}  \) </span>
					<br />
					The velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on position-time graph at that instant.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time interval during which the change occurs : <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \overline{a} = \frac{\triangle{v}}{\triangle{t}}  \) </span>
				</p>
			</li>

					<br />
					The acceleration of an object at a particular time is the slope of the velocity-time graph at that instant of time. For uniform motion, acceleration is zero and the x-t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis and the v-t graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis. For motion with uniform acceleration, x-t graph is a parabola while the v-t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis.</p>

				<p>The area under the velocity-time curve between times <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  t_1  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  t_2  \) </span> is equal to the displacement of the object during that interval of time.</p>

				<p>For objects in uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion, the five quantities, displacement x, time taken t, initial velocity <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v_0  \) </span>, final velocity v and acceleration a are related by a set of simple equations called kinematic equations of motion : <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  v = v_0 + at  \\\\[3pt]

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 4:</h4>
		<p>When a situation demands our immediate action, it takes some time before we really respond. Reaction time is the time a person takes to observe, think and act. For example, if a person is driving and suddenly a boy appears on the road, then the time elapsed before he slams the brakes of the car is the reaction time. Reaction time depends on complexity of the situation and on an individual. You can measure your reaction time by a simple experiment. Take a ruler and ask your friend to drop it vertically through the gap between your thumb and forefinger (Fig. 3.15). After you catch it, find the distance d travelled by the ruler. In a particular case, d was found to be 21.0 cm. Estimate reaction time.</p>
