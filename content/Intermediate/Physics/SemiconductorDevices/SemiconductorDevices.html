	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Energy Bands in Solids </h4>
		<p> We know that in an atom, electrons revolve in definite orbits around the nucleus and each orbit has a definite energy, i.e, atom has its discrete energy states. These energy states are so close to each other that they form an energy band. <br />
			Thus, the group of energy levels (states) very close to each other is called an energy band. <br />
			The band corresponding to energy levels in which number of electrons is equal to the maximum number of electrons allowed by Pauli's exclusion principle (ie, the energy levels are completely filled with electrons) is called the valence band. The band above the valence band corresponding to energy levels in which number of electrons is less than, the maximum number of electrons allowed by the Pauli's exclusion principle, (ie, the energy levels are partially filled with electrons) is called the conduction band.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Classification Of Solids </h4>
		<p> Regarding energy bands in solids, the solids are divided into following three categories </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Conduction Or Metals </span>
						<br />
						The good conductors are those in which the electrons flow easily. Metals are good conductor of electricity. In the following
						two conditions a substance may be good conductor of electricity <br />
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									When conduction band is partially filled then on applying the electric field, the electrons gain energy and go to
									higher energy levels. They get accelerated and constitute the electric current. <br />

									 </div>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									When the valence band and conduction band overlap each other, then the electrons are excited by an electric field and shift to conduction band from valence band. <br />
									<div class="synopsis-image"> 
										<img src="103102015_image-2.png" alt="image2" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
									 </div>
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Insulators </span>
						<br />
						Insulators are those which are poor conductors of electricity. They are also called bad conductors of electricity i.e, glass, mica, ebonite, rubber, pure water, etc, are bad conductors. <br />
						<div class="synopsis-image"> 
							<img src="103102015_image-3.png" alt="image3" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
						 </div>
						In insulators, the forbidden energy gap between valence band and conduction band is very large. <br />
						eg, for diamond forbidden energy gap is 6 eV.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Semiconductors </span>
						<br />
						These substances have conductivity between conductors and insulators. Germanium, silicon, carbon, etc, are semiconductors. <br />
						<div class="synopsis-image"> 
							<img src="103102015_image-4.png" alt="image4" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
						 </div>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p> The forbidden energy gap between conduction band and valence band is very small. At absolute zero, the conduction band is completely empty and the valence band is completely filled. <br />
			At room temperature some electrons in valence band acquire thermal energy. This energy is more than forbidden energy gap Eg, thus, they jump into the conduction band.

	<h3 class="skill-heading"> P-N Junction Diode </h3>
	<p> When a p-type semiconductor is brought into a close contact wit n-type semiconductor crystal, the resulting arrangement is called a p-n junction or junction diode. In the p-type semiconductor, the holes are the majority carriers and electrons are minority carriers whereas in n-type semiconductor, the electrons are majority carriers and holes are minority carriers. </p>

	<p> A transistor is a small device constructed from p- and n-type silicon (or germanium) semiconductors which can be used as a triode valve and transfers the resistance (because transistor = trans + resistance ie, transfer of resistance). In junction transistor, there are three semiconductor surfaces which are known as emitter, base and collector. The middle portion is called base which is very thin of the order of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10^{-6} m  \) </span>. The other two are known as emitter and collector. </p>

				<p>Semiconductors are the basic materials used in the present solid state electronic devices like diode, transistor, ICs, etc.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Lattice structure and the atomic structure of constituent elements decide whether a particular material will be insulator, metal or semiconductor.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Metals have low resistivity <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (10^{-2} \ to \  10^{-8} \ \Omega  \ m  \) </span>), insulators have very high resistivity <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (&gt; 10^8 \ \Omega \ m^{-1}  \) </span>), while semiconductors have intermediate values of resistivity.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Semiconductors are elemental (Si, Ge) as well as compound (GaAs, CdS, etc.).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Pure semiconductors are called ‘intrinsic semiconductors’. The presence of charge carriers (electrons and holes) is an 'intrinsic' property of the material and these are obtained as a result of thermal excitation. The number of electrons <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (n_e)  \) </span> is equal to the number of holes <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (n_h)  \) </span> in intrinsic conductors. Holes are essentially electron vacancies with an effective positive charge.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The number of charge carriers can be changed by 'doping' of a suitable impurity in pure semiconductors. Such semiconductors are known as extrinsic semiconductors. These are of two types (n-type and p-type).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In n-type semiconductors, ne &gt; &gt; nh while in p-type semiconductors <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n_h &gt; &gt; n_e  \) </span>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>n-type semiconducting Si or Ge is obtained by doping with pentavalent atoms (donors) like As, Sb, P, etc., while p-type Si or Ge can be obtained by doping with trivalent atom (acceptors) like B, Al, In etc.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n_e n_h = {n_i}^2  \) </span> in all cases. Further, the material possesses an overall charge neutrality.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The important digital circuits performing special logic operations are called logic gates. These are: OR, AND, NOT, NAND, and NOR gates.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>There are some special circuits which handle the digital data consisting of 0 and 1 levels. This forms the subject of Digital Electronics.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>When the transistor is used in the cutoff or saturation state, it acts as a switch.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>p-n junction is the 'key' to all semiconductor devices. When such a junction is made, a 'depletion layer' is formed consisting of immobile ion-cores devoid of their electrons or holes. This is responsible for a junction potential barrier.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>By changing the external applied voltage, junction barriers can be changed. In forward bias (n-side is connected to negative terminal of the battery and p-side is connected to the positive), the barrier is decreased while the barrier increases in reverse bias. Hence, forward bias current is more (mA) while it is very small <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (\muA)  \) </span> in a p-n junction diode.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Diodes can be used for rectifying an ac voltage (restricting the ac voltage to one direction). With the help of a capacitor or a suitable filter, a dc voltage can be obtained.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>There are some special purpose diodes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Zener diode is one such special purpose diode. In reverse bias, after a certain voltage, the current suddenly increases (breakdown voltage) in a Zener diode. This property has been used to obtain voltage regulation.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>p-n junctions have also been used to obtain many photonic or optoelectronic devices where one of the participating entity is 'photon':
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>Photodiodes in which photon excitation results in a change of reverse saturation current which helps us to measure light intensity; </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Solar cells which convert photon energy into electricity;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> Light Emitting Diode and Diode Laser in which electron excitation by a bias voltage results in the generation of light.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Transistor is an n-p-n or p-n-p junction device. The central block (thin and lightly doped) is called 'Base' while the other electrodes are 'Emitter' and 'Collectors'. The emitter-base junction is forward biased while collector-base junction is reverse biased.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>In modern day circuit, many logical gates or circuits are integrated in one single 'Chip'. These are known as Intgrated circuits (IC).</p>

		<h4 class="solved-examples-question">Example 1:</h4>
		<p>C, Si and Ge have same lattice structure. Why is C insulator while Si and Ge intrinsic semiconductors?<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>
			<br />
			The 4 bonding electrons of C, Si or Ge lie, respectively, in the second, third and fourth orbit. Hence, energy required to take out an electron from these atoms (i.e., ionisation energy <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  E_g  \) </span>) will be least for Ge, followed by Si and highest for C. Hence, number of free electrons for conduction in Ge and Si are significant but negligibly small for C.</p>

			Note that thermally generated electrons <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (n_i \approx \ 10^{16} \ m^{-3})  \) </span> are negligibly small as compared to those produced by doping. <br />

		<p>Can we take one slab of p-type semiconductor and physically join it to another n-type semiconductor to get p-n junction?<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>
			<br />
			No! Any slab, howsoever flat, will have roughness much larger than the inter-atomic crystal spacing <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (\sim \ 2 \ to \ 3 \ \overset{\circ}A)  \) </span> and hence continuous contact at the atomic level will not be possible.

		<p>In a Zener regulated power supply a Zener diode with <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V_Z = 6.0 \ V   \) </span> is used for regulation. The load current is to be 4.0 mA and the unregulated input is 10.0 V. What should be the value of series resistor <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R_S  \) </span>?<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>
			<br />
			The value of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R_S  \) </span> should be such that the current through the Zener diode is much larger than the load current. This is to have good load regulation. Choose Zener current as five times the load current, i.e., <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I_Z  \) </span> = 20 mA. The total current through <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R_S  \) </span> is, therefore, 24 mA.<br />
			The voltage drop across <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R_S  \) </span> is 10.0 - 6.0 = 4.0 V. This gives <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R_S = \frac{4.0V}{(24 \times 10^{-3})} A = 167 \Omega  \) </span> . The nearest value of carbon resistor is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  150 \ \Omega  \) </span>. So, a series resistor of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  150 \ \Omega  \) </span> is appropriate. Note that slight variation in the value of the resistor does not matter, what is important is that the current <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I_Z  \) </span> should be sufficiently larger than <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I_L  \) </span>.</p>

		<p>The current in the forward bias is known to be more <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (\sim mA)  \) </span> than the current in the reverse bias <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (\sim \mu A)  \) </span>. What is the reason then to operate the photodiodes in reverse bias?<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>
			<br />
			Consider the case of an n-type semiconductor.<br />
			Obviously, the majority carrier density (n) is considerably larger than the minority hole density p (i.e., n &gt; ^gt; p). On illumination, let the excess electrons and holes generated be <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \triangle{n}  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \triangle{p}  \) </span>, respectively: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  n' = n + \triangle{n}   \\\\[3pt]
				p' = p + \triangle{p}  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Here n' and p' are the electron and hole concentrations* at any particular illumination and n and p are carriers concentration when there is no illumination. Remember <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \triangle{n}  \) </span> = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \triangle{p}  \) </span> and n &gt; &gt; p. Hence, the fractional change in the majority carriers (i.e.,  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{\triangle{n}}{n}  \) </span> ) would be much less than that in the minority carriers (i.e., <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{\triangle{p}}{p}  \) </span>). In general, we can state that the fractional change due to the photo-effects on the minority carrier dominated reverse bias current is more easily measurable than the fractional change in the forward bias current. Hence, photodiodes are preferably used in the reverse bias condition for measuring light intensity.</p>

		<p>Why are Si and GaAs are preferred materials for solar cells?<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>
			<br />
			The solar radiation spectrum received by us is shown in Fig. </p>

		<p> The maxima is near 1.5 eV. For photo-excitation, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  hv &gt; E_g  \) </span>. Hence, semiconductor with band gap <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sim 1.5 \ eV  \) </span> or lower is likely to give better solar conversion efficiency. Silicon has <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  E_g \sim 1.1 \ eV  \) </span> while for GaAs it is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sim  \) </span> 1.53 eV. In fact, GaAs is better (in spite of its higher band gap) than Si because of its relatively higher absorption coefficient. If we choose materials like CdS or CdSe (<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  E_g \sim  2.4 \ eV  \) </span>), we can use only the high energy component of the solar energy for photo-conversion and a significant part of energy will be of no use. <br />
			The question arises: why we do not use material like <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  PbS (E_g \sim 0.4 \ eV)  \) </span> which satisfy the condition <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  h_ν &gt; E_g  \) </span> for v maxima corresponding to the solar radiation spectra? If we do so, most of the solar radiation will be absorbed on the top-layer of solar cell and will not reach in or near the depletion region. For effective electron-hole separation, due to the junction field, we want the photo-generation to occur in the junction region only.	</p>

		<p>For a CE transistor amplifier, the audio signal voltage across the collector resistance of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2.0 \ k \Omega  \) </span> is 2.0 V. Suppose the current amplification factor of the transistor is 100, What should be the value of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R_B  \) </span> in series with <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V_{BB}  \) </span> supply of 2.0 V if the dc base current has to be 10 times the signal current. Also calculate the dc drop across the collector resistance. (Refer to Fig.).<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>
			<br />
			The output ac voltage is 2.0 V. So, the ac collector current <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  i_C = \frac{2.0}{2000} = 1.0 \ mA  \) </span>. <br />
			The signal current through the base is, therefore given by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  i_B = \frac{i_C}{\beta} = \frac{1.0 mA}{100} = 0.010 \ mA  \) </span>. <br />
			The dc base current has to be <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10 \times 0.010 = 0.10 \ mA  \) </span>. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R_B = \frac{(V_{BB} - V_{BE}}{I_B}  \) </span>. <br />
			Assuming <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V_{BE} = 0.6 \ V  \) </span> , <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R_B = \frac{(2.0 - 0.6)}{0.10} = 14 \ k \Omega  \) </span>. <br />
			The dc collector current <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I_C = 100 \times 0.10 = 10 \ mA  \) </span>. </p>
