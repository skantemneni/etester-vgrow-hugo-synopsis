		<p> It states that the	arity of the induced emf and the direction of induced current are such that they oppose the very cause which produces them. </p>
		<p> Consider the figure shown. A rectangular loop ABCD is being pulled out of the magnetic field directed into and perpendicular to the plane of the paper. As the loop is dragged out of the field, the flux associated with the loop which is directed into the plane of the paper decreases. The induced current will flow in the loop in the sense to oppose the decrease of this flux. For this to happen, the induced current will flow in the coil, so as to exert force on the arm BA towards left. Fleming's left hand rule tells that the current due to induced emf will flow from end A to B.</p>

		<p> Suppose north-pole of a bar magnet is moved towards a loop as shown in the figure. Because of change in magnetic flux associated with the loop, current is induced in it. Due to induced current, magnetic field is induced in such a way so that it opposes the motion of bar magnet. As north pole is moving towards the loop, thus to oppose the motion of the bar magnetic only north pole will be induced on that face of the loop which faces the magnet. Hence, the induced current will be anticlockwise. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">DC Circuits</h3>
	<p>Direct current (DC) circuits basically consist of a loop of conducting wire (like copper) through which an electric current flows. An electric current consists of a flow of electric charges, analogous to the flow of water (water molecules) in a river. In addition to the copper wire in a circuit there usually are components such as resistors which restrict the flow of electric charge, similar to the way rocks and debris in a river restrict the flow of the river water. </p>

			<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Method I </span>
			<br />
			As the rod is rotated, free electrons in the rod move towards the outer end due to Lorentz force and get distributed over the ring. Thus, the resulting separation of charges produces an emf across the ends of the rod. At a certain value of emf, there is no more flow of electrons and a steady state is reached.<br />
			the magnitude of the emf generated across a length dr of the rod as it moves at right angles to the magnetic field is given by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  d \epsilon = Bv \ dr  \) </span>. Hence, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \epsilon = \int \ d \epsilon = \int \limits_{0}^{R} Bv \ dr = \int \limits_{0}^{R} B \omega \ r \ dr = \frac{B \omega \ R^2}{2}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Note that we have used <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v = \Omega \ r  \) </span>. This gives <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \epsilon = \fraac{1}{2} \times 2 \pi \times 50 \times (1^2) = 157 \ V  \) </span>
			<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Method II </span>
			<br />
			To calculate the emf, we can imagine a closed loop OPQ in which point O and P are connected with a resistor R and OQ is the rotating rod. The potential difference across the resistor is then equal to the induced emf and equals B  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   \times  \) </span> (rate of change of area of loop). If  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   \theta  \) </span> is the angle between the rod and the radius of the circle at P at time t, the area of the sector OPQ is given by <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   \pi R^2 \times \frac{\theta}{2 \pi} = \frac{1}{2} R^2 \ \theta  \) </span>
			<br />
			where R is the radius of the circle. Hence, the induced emf is <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \epsilon = B \times \frac{d}{dt} \left [ \frac{1}{2} R^2 \ \theta \right ] = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} BR^2 \ \frac{d \theta}{dt} = \frac{B \omega R^2}{2}  \\\\[3pt]

		<p>Two concentric circular coils, one of small radius <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  r_1  \) </span> and the other of large radius <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  r_2  \) </span>, such that <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  r_1 &lt; &lt;  r_2  \) </span>, are placed co-axially with centres coinciding.

			<span class="highlight01"> Solution </span>
			<br />
			Let a current <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  I_2  \) </span> flow through the outer circular coil. The field at the centre of the coil is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  B_2 = \frac{\mu_0 \ I_2}{2 r_2}  \) </span>. Since the other co-axially placed coil has a very small radius, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  B_2  \) </span> may be considered constant over its cross-sectional area. Hence, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \Phi_1 = \pi \ {r_1}^2 \ B_2  \\\\[3pt]

				= M_{12} I_2  \\\\[3pt]
				Thus,  \\\\[3pt]
				M_{12} = \frac{\mu_0 \ \pi \ {r_1}^2}{2 r_2}  \\\\[3pt]
				M_{12} = M_{21} = \frac{\mu_0 \ pi \ {r_1}^2}{2 r_2} \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Note that we calculated <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  M_{12}  \) </span> from an approximate value of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \Phi_1  \) </span>, assuming the magnetic field <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  B_2  \) </span> to be uniform over the area <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \pi \ {r_1}^2  \) </span>. However, we can accept this value because <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  r_1 &lt; &lt; r_2  \) </span>.</p>
