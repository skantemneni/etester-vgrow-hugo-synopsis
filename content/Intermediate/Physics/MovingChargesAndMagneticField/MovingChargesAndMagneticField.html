		<p>A solenoid of length 0.5 m has a radius of 1 cm and is made up of 500 turns. It carries a current of 5 A. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid?<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Solution </span>
			<br />
			The number of turns per unit length is, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n = \frac{500}{0.5} = 1000 \ \frac{truns}{m}   \) </span>
			<br />
			The length l = 0.5 m and radius r = 0.01 m. Thus,  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{l}{a} = 50 \ i.e., \ l \gg  a  \) </span>. <br />
			Hence, we can use the long solenoid formula, namely,  <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  B = \mu_0 \ n \ I  \\\\[3pt]
				= 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \times 10^3 \times 5  \\\\[3pt]
				= 6.28 \times 10^{-3} \ T  \end{align}  \) </span>
