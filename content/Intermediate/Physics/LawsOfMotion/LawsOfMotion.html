No. It turns out that many situations involving <span class="highlight01"> collisions </span> do not obey the simple conservation of Mechanical Energy. Why not?

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Rocket Propulsion</h3>
	<p>Rockets (and jet engines) work much like a balloon filled with air. <br/>
		If you fill a balloon with air and hold the neck closed, the pressure inside the balloon is slightly higher than the surrounding atmosphere. However, there is no net force on the balloon in any direction because the internal pressure on the balloon is equal in all directions. <br/>
		If you release the neck of the balloon, it acts like a hole, with no surface area for the internal pressure to act on. There is now an imbalanced force on the balloon, and the internal pressure on the front of the balloon is greater than the internal pressure on the back of the balloon. <br/>
		This results in a net force acting forward on the balloon-thrust. The balloon flies forward under the influence of the thrust, and the air coming out of the back of the balloon is the equal and opposite reaction to the thrust.

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Equilibrium</h3>
	<p>If a number of forces act at the same point, they are called concurrent forces. <br/>
		Consider that a body is under the action of a number of forces. Suppose that the body remains in equilibrium under the action of these forces ie, the body remains in its state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line, when acted upon these forces. <br/>
		The condition that body may be in equilibrium or the number of forces acting on the body may be in equilibrium is that these forces  should produce a zero resultant force. <br/>
		Therefore, the resultant of three concurrent forces will be zero and hence they will be in equilibrium , if they can be represented completely by the three sides of any triangle. <br/>
		In case, a number of forces act at a point, then they will be in equilibrium, if they can be represented completely by the sides of a closed polygon taken in order.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Normal Reaction </h4>
		<p>When a body is pressed against a surface, the surface (even a seemingly rigid surface) deforms and pushes on the body with
			a normal reaction force <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \vec{N}  \) </span> that is perpendicular to the surface.
		</p>
		<p> For a simple introduction to the normal reaction force, consider a situation in which you put a book on your head and continue your stationary position. In this case the pain you feel is due the force that the book exerts on your head. In the language of physics, the book exerts a force on your head normal to the surface of contact in downward direction. According to Newton's third law of motion, the head exerts a force of same magnitude on the book normal to the surface of contact and in upward direction. Normal reaction is the adjustable force that acts at the contact points of two bodies in direction normal to the surface. <br/>
			These forces are known as normal reaction forces. Normal reaction forces in different situations are shown below

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Pulley</h3>
	<p>A rope and pulley system -- that is, a block and tackle -- is characterised by the use of a single continuous rope to transmit a tension force around one or more pulleys to lift or move a load-the rope may be a light line or a strong cable. This system is included in the list of simple machines identified by Renaissance scientists.<br/>
		If the rope and pulley system does not dissipate or store energy, then its mechanical advantage is the number of parts of the rope that act on the load. This can be shown as follows. <br/>
		Consider the set of pulleys that form the moving block and the parts of the rope that support this block. If there are p of these parts of the rope supporting the load W, then a force balance on the moving block shows that the tension in each of the parts of the rope must be  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{W}{p}  \) </span>. This means the input force on the rope is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  T = \frac{W}{p}  \) </span>. Thus, the block and tackle reduces the input force by the factor p.

			<li>
				<p>Aristotle’s view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. A force is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and arrived at the law of inertia. Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased thus: "Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise". In simple terms, the First Law is <span class="highlight01"> "If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero" </span>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Momentum (p) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) : p = mv </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Newton's second law of motion : </span>
					<br />
					The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. Thus <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F = k \frac{dp}{dt} = k \ ma  \) </span>
					<br />
					where F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant of proportionality k = 1 in S.I. Then <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F = \frac{dp}{dt} = ma  \) </span>
					<br />
					The SI unit of force is newton :  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1 \ N = 1 \ kg \ m \ s^{-2}  \) </span>.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>The second law is consistent with the First Law (F = 0 implies a = 0)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>It is a vector equation</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided F is the total external force on the system and a is the acceleration of the system as a whole.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant. That is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the history of motion.</p>
					</li>
				</ol> 
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum. The notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a measurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short, one can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during the action of the impulsive force.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Newton's third law of motion: </span>
					<br />
					To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction In simple terms, the law can be stated thus : <br />
					<i> Forces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies. Force on a body A by body B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A. </i>
					<br />
					Action and reaction forces are simultaneous forces. There is no cause-effect relation between action and reaction. Any of the two mutual forces can be called action and the other reaction. Action and reaction act on different bodies and so they cannot be cancelled out. The internal action and reaction forces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero.</p>

						Impulse and force are in the same direction. Clearly, from above, the force on the ball due to the wall is normal to the wall, along the negative x-direction. Using Newton's third law of motion, the force on the wall due to the ball is normal to the wall along the positive x-direction. The magnitude of force cannot be ascertained since the small time taken for the collision has not been specified in the problem.</p>

		<p>See Fig. A mass of 6 kg is suspended by a rope of length 2 m from the ceiling. A force of 50 N in the horizontal direction is applied at the midpoint P of the rope, as shown. What is the angle the rope makes with the vertical in equilibrium? (Take <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  g = 10 \ m \ s^{-2}  \) </span>). Neglect the mass of the rope. </p>

			<br />
			Figures (b) and (c) are known as free-body diagrams. Figure 5.8(b) is the free-body diagram of W and Fig. 5.8(c) is the free-body diagram of point P. <br />
			Consider the equilibrium of the weight W. Clearly, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  T_2 = 6 \times 10 = 60 \ N  \) </span>
			<br />
			Consider the equilibrium of the point P under the action of three forces - the tensions <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  T_1  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  T_2  \) </span> , and the horizontal force 50 N. The horizontal and vertical components of the resultant force must vanish separately : <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  T_1 \ cos \ \theta = T_2 = 60 \ N  \\\\[3pt]
				T_1 \ sin \ \theta = 50 \ N  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			which gives that <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  tan \ \theta = \frac{5}{6} \ or \ \theta = tan^{-1} \left ( \frac{5}{6} \right ) = 40^{\circ}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Note the answer does not depend on the length of the rope (assumed massless) nor on the point at which the horizontal force is applied.</p>
