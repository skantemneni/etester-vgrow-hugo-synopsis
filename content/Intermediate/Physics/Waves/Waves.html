	<h3 class="skill-heading">Strings (speed of a travelling wave)</h3>
	<p>A string of length L is stretched tween two points. When the string is set into vibrations, a transverse progressive wave begins to travel along the string:It is reflected at the other fixed end. The incident and the reflected waves interfere to produce a stationary transverse wave in which the ends are always nodes.Various modes of vibrations of a stretched string are shown.</p>

				<p>In the simplest form, when the string is plucked in the middle, it vibrates in one loop in which the ends are the nodes and the centre is the antinode. This mode of vibration is known as the fundamental node and the frequency of vibration is known as the fundamental frequency of first harmonic. <br />

					If <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( f_1 \) </span> is the fundamental frequency of vibration, then the velocity of transverse waves is given as <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( v = \lambda_1 f_1 \ or \ f_1 = \frac{v}{2L} \Rightarrow v = 2Lf_1.....(i) \) </span>

					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( f_1 = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{ \frac{T}{m}} \) </span>
					<br />
					It is called the fundamental frequency or the pitch of the tone or first harmonic</p>

				<p>The same string under the same conditions may also vibrate in two loops. such that the centre is also the node. <br />

	<h3 class="skill-heading">	Velocity of sound</h3>
	<p>A musical sound consists of a quick succession of regular and periodic <span class="highlight01"> compressions </span> and <span class="highlight01">rarefactions </span> without any sudden change in amplitude.While a <span class="highlight01"> noise </span> consists of slow succession of irregular and periodic <span class="highlight01">rarefactions </span> and <span class="highlight01"> compressions </span> accompanied by a sudden change in amplitude.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Laws of vibration of stretched string</h4>
		<p>Musical sounds differ from each other due to the following three characteristics <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Pitch:- </span> Pitch is the characteristic of sound that depends on frequency. It determines the <span class="highlight01">shrillness </span> or <span class="highlight01">graveness </span> of sound.Smaller the frequency smaller is the pitch, greater the frequency greater is the pitch. Frequency of ladies voice is usually higher than that of gents'. Therefore, ladies voice has higher pitch (sharper) than gents'.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Loudness:- </span> As discussed earlier, the loudness being a sensation, depends upon the sensitivity of the listener's ears. Therefore, loudness of a sound of given intensity may be different for different listeners. Hence it depends on intensity of sound.<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( L = 10 \ log_{10} \left( \frac{I}{I_0} \right) \) </span>
			<br />
			where, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( I_0 \) </span> is the intensity of minimum audible sound which is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10^{ - 12} Wm^{-2} \) </span>
			<br />
			Humming of mosquito has a high pitch (high frequency) but intensity (low loudness) while the roar of a lion has high tensity (loudness) but low pitch.<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Quality:- </span> Quality is that characteristic of sound by which we can differentiate between the sounds coming from different sources. Quality of sound depends on the number of overtones and their relative intensities. If same note is played on different instruments say <span class="highlight01"> sitar </span> and <span class="highlight01"> veena </span>, at same loudness and same frequency, they produce different sensation on our ears due to their different quality.</p>

	<p>Musical wind instruments like flute, clarinet etc. are based on the principle of vibrations of air columns. Due to the superposition of the incident wave and the reflected wave, longitudinal stationary waves are formed in the pipe.<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Organ pipes : </span> Organ pipes are musical instruments which are used to produce musical sound by blowing air into the pipe. Organ pipes are two types </p>

					<div class="synopsis-image">

					There is a node at the closed end and an antinode at the open end. If l is the length of the tube,<br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  l = \frac{ \lambda_1}{4} \ or \ \lambda_1 = 4l.......(1)  \) </span>
					<br />
					If <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n_1  \) </span> is the fundamental frequency of the vibrations and v is the velocity of sound in air, then <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n_1 = \frac{v}{ \lambda_1} = \frac{v}{4 l}.......(2)  \) </span>
					<br />
					If air is blown strongly at the open end, frequencies higher than fundamental frequency can be produced. They are called overtones. img 5 shows the mode of vibration with two or more nodes and antinodes.

					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( l = \frac{3 \lambda_3}{4} \ or \lambda_3 = \frac{4 l}{3}.......(3) \) </span>

					This is called as second overtone or fifth harmonic.<br />
					Therefore the frequency of pth overtone is  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (2p + 1) n_1 \) </span> where n1 is the fundamental frequency. In a closed pipe only odd harmonics are produced. The frequencies of harmonics are in the ratio of 1 : 3 : 5.....</p>
			</li>

				<p>
					<span class="highlight01">Open organ pipe </span>
					<br />
					When air is blown into the open organ pipe, the air column vibrates in the fundamental mode as shown in figure. Antinodes are formed at the ends and a node is formed in the middle of the pipe. If l is the length of the pipe, then

			<br />
			We know that 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 litres at STP. Therefore, density of air at STP is : <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \rho_0  \) </span> = (mass of one mole of air)/(volume of one mole of air at STP) <br />

		<p>Two sitar strings A and B playing the note 'Dha' are slightly out of tune and produce beats of frequency 5 Hz. The tension of the string B is slightly increased and the beat frequency is found to decrease to 3 Hz. What is the original frequency of B if the frequency of A is 427 Hz?.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution</span>

			Increase in the tension of a string increases its frequency.

Since <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v_A - v_B = 5 \ Hz  \) </span>, and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v_A = 427 \ Hz  \) </span>, we get <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   v_B = 422 \ Hz  \) </span>.</p>
