	<p>Suppose the car is going around an unbanked (level) curve. The diagram at below shows a free - body diagram of the forces acting on the car. </p>

	<p>The downward force labeled "mg" is the weight of the car (the Earth pulling downward on the car). The upward force, labeled "N" (for "Normal") is the force the road exerts on the car perpendicular to the surface of the road. We know that the car is not accelerating vertically, so Newton's First Law tells us that these two forces must cancel exactly, so that the vertical net force on the car is zero. <br />
		We know that there must be a horizontal net force on the car, however - the centripetal force. In the diagram, the horizontal force labeled "f" represents the horizontal friction force that the road exerts on the car's tires. This force must be the centripetal force! This friction force points toward the center of the turn, and is responsible for turning the car. <br />
		So, in an unbanked turn, the force responsible for turning the car is the friction force between the tires and the road. To see how this works, think of what would happen if there were no friction. Have you ever found yourself driving on ice? The car doesn't want to turn because there is little or no friction between the ice-covered road and the car's tires. Usually you are too panicked at the time to notice, but you slide straight ahead into the ditch! <br />
		Another very important feature of this diagram is there is NO outward-pointing force! The friction force points inward - toward the center of the turn (circle). Yes, you feel "thrown outward," but this is due to your inertia. There is no centrifugal force! <br />
		From the free-body diagram above and Newton's Second Law we can write: <br />
		N = mg (vertical forces cancel) <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_{net} = F_{centripetal} = f (horizontal net force)  \) </span>
		<br />
		Remember that <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_{centripetal} = \frac{mv^2}{r}  \) </span>

			<br />
			As the string is inextensible, and the pully is smooth, the 3 kg block and the 20 kg trolley both have same magnitude of acceleration. Applying second law to motion of the block (Fig.(b)), <br />
			30 - T = 3a <br />

			On an unbanked road, frictional force alone can provide the centripetal force needed to keep the cyclist moving on a circular turn without slipping. If the speed is too large, or if the turn is too sharp (i.e. of too small a radius) or both, the frictional force is not sufficient to provide the necessary centripetal force, and the cyclist slips.

			On a banked road, the horizontal component of the normal force and the frictional force contribute to provide centripetal force to keep the car moving on a circular turn without slipping.
