		<p>Consider a small surface of area A such as a small card submerged in the fluid. The fluid on one side of the card exets a force F on the card which is balanced by an equal but opposite force is exerted by the fluid on the other side of the card. If the card is very small, we can neglect the difference in depth of the card. The pressure p is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the force to the area of the card ie. <br/>

		<p> Whenever a body is immersed in a fluid, the fluid exerts an upward force on the body, which is called the buoyant force. In fact, any body wholly or partially immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. This result is known as Archimedes' principle. Thus, buoyant force = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V_i \rho_l g  \) </span> where <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V_i  \) </span>, is the volume of immersed part of body and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \rho_l  \) </span>, is the density of fluid. </p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Viscous Force</h3>
	<p> The property of a fluid due to which it opposes the relative motion between its different layers is called viscosity (or fluid friction or internal friction) and the force between the layers opposing the relative motion is called viscous force. <br/>
		According to Newton, the frictional force F (or viscous force) between two layers depends upon the following factors
	</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p> Force F is directly proportional to the area (A) of the layers in contact, ie, <br/>

				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Force F is directly proportional to the velocity gradient <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( \frac{dv}{dy} \right )  \) </span> between the layers. Combining these two, we have <br/>
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F \propto A \frac{dv}{dy}  \) </span>

	<p> In case of a steady flow of a liquid of viscosity <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \eta  \) </span> in a capillary tube of length L and radius R under a pressure difference P across it, the volume of liquid flowing per second is given by <br/>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Surface Energy And Work Done</h3>
	<p> The molecules on the liquid surface experience a net downward force. So, to bring a molecule from the interior of the liquid to the free surface some work is required to be done against the intermolecular forces of attraction. This work done is stored in the surface film of the liquid as its potential energy. <br/>
		The potential energy per unit area of the surface film is called the surface energy. <br/>
		It may also be defined as the amount of work done in increasing the surface area of the film by unity. Thus surface energy <br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  = \frac{ \text{work done in increasing the surface area}}{\text{increase in surface area}}  \) </span>
		<br/>
		If we establish a relation between surface energy and surface tension, then it is found that the surface tension of liquid is numerically equal to its surface energy
	</p>
	<p> Hence, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  S = \frac{W}{\Delta A}  \) </span>
		<br/>
		or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  W = S \Delta A  \) </span>
		<br/>
		i.e, surface tension may be defined as the amount of work done in increasing the area of the liquid surface by unity against the force of surface tension at constant temperature. <br/>
		When the surface area of the liquid is increased, work is done against the cohesive force of molecules and this work is stored in the form of additional surface energy. <br/>
		Increase in surface potential energy <br/>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Excess Pressure</h3>
	<span class="highlight01"> The excess pressure within a bubble </span>
	<br/>
	<p>The fact that air has to be blown into a drop of soap solution to make a bubble should suggest that the pressure within the bubble is greater than that outside. This is in fact the case: this excess pressure creates a force that is just balanced by the inward pull of the soap film of the bubble due to its surface tension. <br/>
		Consider a soap bubble of radius r as shown in Figure. Let the external pressure be <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P_{\circ}  \) </span> and the internal pressure <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P_1  \) </span>. <br/>
		The excess pressure P within the bubble is therefore given by : <br/>
		Excess pressure = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P_1 - P_1  \) </span>
		<br/>
		<div class="synopsis-image"> 
			<img src="103101012_image-5.png" alt="image5" class="default-synopsis-medium-image" />
		 </div>
		Consider the left-hand half of the bubble. The force acting from right to left due to the internal excess pressure can be shown to be PA, where A is the area of a section through the centre of the bubble. If the bubble is in equilibrium this force is balanced by a force due to surface tension acting from left to right. This force is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2 \times 2 \pi rT  \) </span> (the factor of 2 is necessary because the soap film has two sides) where T is the coefficient of surface tension of the soap film. Therefore <br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2 \times 2 \pi rT = PA = P \pi r^2  \) </span> giving: <br/>
		Excess pressure in a soap bubble (P) = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{4T}{r}  \) </span>
		<br/>
		A bubble of air within a liquid has only one liquid-air surface and the excess pressure within such a bubble is simply: <br/>
		Excess pressure in an air bubble (P) = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{2T}{r}  \) </span>
		<br/>
		Both these formulae show that the excess pressure within a small bubble is greater than that within a larger bubble.

			In reality the density of air decreases with height. So does the value of g. The atmospheric cover extends with decreasing pressure over 100 km. We should also note that the sea level atmospheric pressure is not always 760 mm of Hg. A drop in the Hg level by 10 mm or more is a sign of an approaching storm.</p>

		<p>The lower end of a capillary tube of diameter 2.00 mm is dipped 8.00 cm below the surface of water in a beaker. What is the pressure required in the tube in order to blow a hemispherical bubble at its end in water? The surface tension of water at temperature of the experiments is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  7.30 \times 10^{-2} \ Nm^{-1}  \) </span>. 1 atmospheric pressure = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1.01 \times 10^5 \ Pa  \) </span>, density of water = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1000 \frac{kg}{m^3}, \ g = 9.80 \ m \ s^{-2}  \) </span>. Also calculate the excess pressure.<br />
			<span class="highlight01">Solution</span>
			<br />
			The excess pressure in a bubble of gas in a liquid is given by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{2S}{r}  \) </span>, where S is the surface tension of the liquid-gas interface. You should note there is only one liquid surface in this case. (For a bubble of liquid in a gas, there are two liquid surfaces, so the formula for excess pressure in that case is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{4S}{r}  \) </span>.) The radius of the bubble is r. Now the pressure outside the bubble Po equals atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to 8.00 cm of water column. That is <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  p_0 = \left ( 1.01 \times 10^5 \ Pa + 0.08 \ m \times 1000 \ kg \ m^{-3} \times 9.80 \ m \ s^{-2} \right )  \\\\[3pt]
				= 1.01784 \times 10^5 \ Pa  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Therefore, the pressure inside the bubble is<br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  P_1 = P_0 + \frac{2S}{r}  \\\\[3pt]
				= 1.01784 \times 10^5 \ Pa + (2 \times 7.3 \times 10^{-2} \ Pa \ m / 10^{-3} \ m)  \\\\[3pt]

				= 1.02 \times 10^5 \ Pa  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			where the radius of the bubble is taken to be equal to the radius of the capillary tube, since the bubble is hemispherical ! (The answer has been rounded off to three significant figures.) The excess pressure in the bubble is 146 Pa.</p>
