		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Nucleus </h4>
		<p> Each substance is composed of atoms. The entire positive charge and nearly the entire mass of atom is concentrated in a very small space called the nucleus of an atom. The radius of nucleus is of order of the nearly <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10^{-15}m  \) </span> to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10^{-14}m  \) </span> . The nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. They are called nucleons. </p>
		<p> In a nucleus, the number of protons is equal to the atomic number of that element and the remaining particles to fulfil the mass number are the neutrons, ie. <br />
			number of protons = atomic number Z (say) and number of neutrons <br />
			= Mass number (A) - atomic number (Z) <br />
			= A - Z <br />
			Thus, the nucleus of an atom represented as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  _ZX^A  \) </span>, i.e, nucleus of X contains Z protons and (A - Z) neutrons.

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Nuclear Fission, Nuclear Fusion and Elementary Particles</h3>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Nuclear Fission </h4>
		<p> The process of splitting of a heavy nucleus into two light nuclei of nearly comparable masses with the liberation of energy is called nuclear fission. <br />
			In each fission reaction a tremendous amount of energy <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (\approx 190 MeV)  \) </span> is released. <br />
			When slow neutron strikes the <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  U^{235}  \) </span> nucleus, it gets absorbed in it and a most unstable isotope <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  U^{236}  \) </span> is formed which splits into the two nuclei barium <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (_{56}Ba^{144})  \) </span> and krypton <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (_{36}Kr^{89})  \) </span>, with the release of three neutrons and a tremendous amount of energy. The reaction occurs as follows <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \underset{(uranium)}{_{92} U^{235}} + \underset{(neutron)}{_0n^1} \rightarrow _{92} U^{236} \rightarrow \underset{(Barium)}{_{56}Ba^{144}} + \underset{(krypton)}{_{36}Kr^{89}} + 3 _0n^1 + energy  \) </span>
		</p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Chain Reaction of Nuclear Fission </h5>
		<p>For the fission of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  U^{235}  \) </span> we need only one neutron but in this process 3 fast moving neutrons are emitted, these 3 neutrons, make fission of three uranium nuclei and further we get of 9 fast moving neutrons. Hence, this is a chain of nuclear fission form, it is called chain reaction of nuclear fission. It is of two types </p>
		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01"> Controlled chain reaction </span> In this process, the number of neutrons produced is controlled by absorbing a desired number of neutrons. This principle is used in nuclear reactor. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Uncontrolled chain reaction </span> In this process, the number of neutrons produced is not controlled, it results in a heavy explosion. This principle is used in atom bomb. </p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p> In the <span class="highlight01">'atomic bomb' </span> an increasing uncontrolled chain reaction occurs in a very short time when two pieces of uranium-235 are rapidly brought together to form a mass greater than the critical size. </p>
		<h5 class="note">Note: </h5>
		<p> The minimum size of the piece of radioactive element to continue the chain reaction is called critical size. </p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Nuclear Fusion </h4>
		<p>Binding energy for light nuclei (A &lt; 20) is much smaller than the binding energy for heavier nuclei. This suggests a process that is the reverse of fission. When two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, the process is called nuclear fusion. The union of light nuclei into heavier nuclei also lead to a transfer of mass and a consequent liberation of energy. Such a reaction has been achieved in <span class="highlight01"> hydrogen bomb </span> and it is believed to be the principal source of the sun's energy. </p>
		<p> For example, when two deuteron nuclei <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (_1H^2)  \) </span> fuse, 3.3 MeV energy is released and the nucleus of helium isotope <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (_2He^3)  \) </span> is formed. This helium isotope again get fused with one deuteron nucleus to form a helium nucleus <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (_2He^4)  \) </span> and 18.3 MeV energy is released in this process. The nuclear reactions are <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  \underset{(Deuteron)}{_1H^2} + \underset{(Deuteron)}{_1H^2} \rightarrow \underset{(Helium \ isotope)}{_2He^3} + \underset{(Neutron)}{_0n^1} + 3.3 MeV  \\\\[3pt]
				\underset{(Helium \ isotope)}{_2He^3} + \underset{(Deuteron)}{_1H^2} \rightarrow \underset{(Helium)}{_2He^4} + \underset{(proton)}{_1H^1} + 18.3 MeV  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Thus, in all, three deuteron nuclei fuse to form a helium nucleus with a release of 21.6 MeV energy. A part of this energy is obtained in form of kinetic energy of neutron <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (_0n^1)  \) </span> and proton <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (_1H^1)  \) </span>. <br />
			Nuclear fusion is not possible at ordinary temperature and ordinary pressure. The reason is that when the nuclides approach each other, due to their positive charge the electrostatic force of repulsion between them becomes too strong that they do not fuse. Hence, to make the fusion possible, a high temperature <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (\approx 10^7 K)  \) </span> and high pressure is required. <br />
			So, much high temperature is obtained by using (fission) bomb to trigger off fusion. <br />
			If a controlled fusion reaction can be obtained an almost unlimited supply of energy will become available from deuterium in the water of the oceans.

				<p>An atom has a nucleus. The nucleus is positively charged. The radius of the nucleus is smaller than the radius of an atom by a factor of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( 10^4  \) </span>. More than 99.9% mass of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>On the atomic scale, mass is measured in atomic mass units (u).

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A nucleus contains a neutral particle called neutron. Its mass is almost the same as that of proton</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The atomic number Z is the number of protons in the atomic nucleus of an element. The mass number A is the total number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus; A = Z + N; Here N denotes the number of neutrons in the nucleus.<br />
					A nuclear species or a nuclide is represented as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( {^A_Z}X  \) </span> where X is the chemical symbol of the species. Nuclides with the same atomic number Z, but different neutron number N are called isotopes. Nuclides with the same A are isobars and those with the same N are isotones. <br />
					Most elements are mixtures of two or more isotopes. The atomic mass of an element is a weighted average of the masses of its isotopes. The masses are the relative abundances of the isotopes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A nucleus can be considered to be spherical in shape and assigned a radius. Electron scattering experiments allow determination of the nuclear radius; it is found that radii of nuclei fit the formula <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R = R_0 \ AA^{\frac{1}{3}}  \) </span>
					<br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  R_0  \) </span> a constant = 1.2 fm. This implies that the nuclear density is independent of A. It is of the order of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10^{17} \ \frac{kg}{m^3}  \) </span>

				<p>Neutrons and protons are bound in a nucleus by the short-range strong nuclear force. The nuclear force does not distinguish between neutron and proton.</p>

			<li>
				<p>The nuclear mass M is always less than the total mass, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sum m  \) </span>, of its constituents. The difference in mass of a nucleus and its constituents is called the mass defect, <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \triangle{M} = (Z m_p + (A - Z)m_n) - M  \) </span>

					Using Einstein's mass energy relation, we express this mass difference in terms of energy as <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \triangle{E_b} = \triangle{M} c^2  \) </span>
					<br />
					The energy <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \triangle{E_b}  \) </span> represents the binding energy of the nucleus. In the mass number range A = 30 to 170, the binding energy per nucleon is nearly constant, about 8 MeV/nucleon.</p>

				<p>The Q-value of a nuclear process is <br />

The half-life <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{T_1}{2}  \) </span> of a radionuclide is the time in which N has been reduced to one-half of its initial value.

				<p>Energy is released when less tightly bound nuclei are transmuted into more tightly bound nuclei. In fission, a heavy nucleus like <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ^{235}_{92}U  \) </span> breaks into two smaller fragments, e.g., <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  ^{235}_{92}U + \ ^{1}_0 N \rightarrow \ ^{133}_{51}Sb + \ ^{99}_{41}Nb + 4 \ ^1_0 N  \) </span>

				<p>The fact that more neutrons are produced in fission than are consumed gives the possibility of a chain reaction with each neutron that is produced triggering another fission.

In a reactor, the value of the neutron multiplication factor k is maintained at 1.</p>

			<span class="highlight01">Solution </span>
		</p>
		<div class="list1-ol default-spaced-indented list-numbered-style-lower-alpha">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>A chemical equation is balanced in the sense that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation. A chemical reaction merely alters the original combinations of atoms. In a nuclear reaction, elements may be transmuted. Thus, the number of atoms of each element is not necessarily conserved in a nuclear reaction. However, the number of protons and the number of neutrons are both separately conserved in a nuclear reaction. [Actually, even this is not strictly true in the realm of very high energies - what is strictly conserved is the total charge and total 'baryon number'. We need not pursue this matter here.] In nuclear reactions, the number of protons and the number of neutrons are the same on the two sides of the equation.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>We know that the binding energy of a nucleus gives a negative contribution to the mass of the nucleus (mass defect). Now, since proton number and neutron number are conserved in a nuclear reaction, the total rest mass of neutrons and protons is the same on either side of a reaction. But the total binding energy of nuclei on the left side need not be the same as that on the right hand side. The difference in these binding energies appears as energy released or absorbed in a nuclear reaction. Since binding energy contributes to mass, we say that the difference in the total mass of nuclei on the two sides get converted into energy or vice-versa. It is in these sense that a nuclear reaction is an example of massenergy interconversion.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>From the point of view of mass-energy interconversion, a chemical reaction is similar to a nuclear reaction in principle. The energy released or absorbed in a chemical reaction can be traced to the difference in chemical (not nuclear) binding energies of atoms and molecules on the two sides of a reaction. Since, strictly speaking, chemical binding energy also gives a negative contribution (mass defect) to the total mass of an atom or molecule, we can equally well say that the difference in the total mass of atoms or molecules, on the two sides of the chemical reaction gets converted into energy or vice-versa. However, the mass defects involved in a chemical reaction are almost a million times smaller than those in a nuclear reaction.This is the reason for the general impression, (which is incorrect ) that mass-energy interconversion does not take place in a chemical reaction.</p>
