	<h3 class="skill-heading"> Electric Potential Energy </h3>
	<p> The electric energy of a system of charges is the work that has been done in bringing those charges from infinity to near each other to form the system. For two point charges <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_1  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_2  \) </span> eparated by distance <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  r_{12}  \) </span>, the potential energy is given by <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  U = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}}  \) </span>

		If there are more than two charges in a system, then the electric energy is calculated for each pair and then all energies so obtained, are added algebraically. For example, for a system of three charges <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_1 q_2  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_3  \) </span> are placed at three corners of a triangle (figure), then the electric potential energy of the system will be given by <br />

		In general, for a system of n charges the electric potential energy is given by <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  U = \frac{1}{2} \sum \frac{q_i q_j}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r_{ij}} i \neq j  \) </span>

				<p>Electrostatic force is a conservative force. Work done by an external force (equal and opposite to the electrostatic force) in bringing a charge q from a point R to a point P is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V_P - V_R  \) </span>, which is the difference in potential energy of charge q between the final and initial points</p>

				<p>Potential at a point is the work done per unit charge (by an external agency) in bringing a charge from infinity to that point. Potential at a point is arbitrary to within an additive constant, since it is the potential difference between two points which is physically significant. If potential at infinity is chosen to be zero; potential at a point with position vector r due to a point charge Q placed at the origin is given is given by <br />

				<p>For a charge configuration <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_1, \ q_2,..., q_n  \) </span> with position vectors <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  r_1, \ r_2, ... r_n  \) </span>, the potential at a point P is given by the superposition principle <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left ( \frac{q_1}{r_{1p}} + \frac{q_2}{r_{2p}} + ..... + \frac{q_n}{r_{np}}\right )  \) </span>

				<p>An equipotential surface is a surface over which potential has a constant value. For a point charge, concentric spheres centered at a location of the charge are equipotential surfaces. The electric field E at a point is perpendicular to the equipotential surface through the point. E is in the direction of the steepest decrease of potential.</p>

			<li>
				<p>Potential energy stored in a system of charges is the work done (by an external agency) in assembling the charges at their locations. Potential energy of two charges <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_1, \ q_2 \ at \ r_1, \ r_2  \) </span> is given by<br />

				<p>Electrostatics field E is zero in the interior of a conductor; just outside the surface of a charged conductor, E is normal to the surface given by <br />

Charges in a conductor can reside only at its surface. Potential is constant within and on the surface of a conductor. In a cavity within a conductor (with no charges), the electric field is zero.</p>

				<p>A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator. Its capacitance is defined by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C = \frac{Q}{V}  \) </span>, where Q and -Q are the charges on the two conductors and V is the potential difference between them. C is determined purely geometrically, by the shapes, sizes and relative positions of the two conductors. The unit of capacitance is farad:, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1F = 1 \ C \ V^{-1}  \) </span>. For a parallel plate capacitor (with vacuum between the plates),<br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C = \ epsilon_0 \frac{A}{d}  \) </span>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If the medium between the plates of a capacitor is filled with an insulating substance (dielectric), the electric field due to the charged plates induces a net dipole moment in the dielectric. This effect, called polarisation, gives rise to a field in the opposite direction. The net electric field inside the dielectric and hence the potential difference between the plates is thus reduced. Consequently, the capacitance C increases from its value <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C_0  \) </span> when there is no medium (vacuum), <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C = KC_0  \) </span> where K is the dielectric constant of the insulating substance.</p>

				<p>The energy U stored in a capacitor of capacitance C, with charge Q and voltage V is <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  U = \frac{1}{2} QV = \frac{1}{2} CV^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q^2}{C}  \) </span>
