		<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms, molecules and bulk matter.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that there are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel and unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod rubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is then negative.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them, insulators do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in electrolytes both positive and negative ions are mobile.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity and conservation. <br />
						Quantisation of electric charge means that total charge (q) of a body is always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge (e) i.e., q = n e, where <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  n = 0, \ \pm 1, \ \pm 2,  \pm 3,....  \) </span> Proton and electron have charges +e, -e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large number, quantisation of charge can be ignored. <br />
						Additivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system is the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs) of all individual charges in the system. <br /> Conservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an isolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when bodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge from one body to another, but no creation or destruction of charge.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Coulomb's Law: The mutual electrostatic force between two point charges <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_1  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_2  \) </span>  is proportional to the product <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_1 q_2  \) </span> and inversely proportional to the square of the distance <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  r_{21}  \) </span> separating them. Mathematically, <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F_{21} = force \ on \ q_2 \ due \ to q_1 = \frac{k (q_1 q_2)}{r_{21}} \hat{r_{21}}  \) </span>
						<br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \hat{r_{21}}  \) </span>   is a unit vector in the direction from <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_1 \ to \ q_2  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  k = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}  \) </span> is the constant of proportionality. <br />
						In SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value of the constant <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \epsilon_{0}  \) </span>  is <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \epsilon_{0} = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \ C^2 \ N^{-1} \ m^{-2}  \) </span>
						<br />
						The approximate value of k is <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  k = 9 \times 10^9 \ N m^2 \ C^{-2}  \) </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a proton and an electron is <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{k e^2}{G \ m_e \ m_p} \ \cong \ 2.4 \times 10^{39}  \) </span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Superposition Principle: The principle is based on the property that the forces with which two charges attract or repel each other are not affected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). For an assembly of charges <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_1, \ q_2, \ q_3, ...,  \) </span> the force on any charge, say <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_1  \) </span> , isthe vector sum of the force on q1 due to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_2  \) </span>, the force on q1 due to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_3  \) </span>, and so on. For each pair, the force is given by the Coulomb's law for two charges stated earlier. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The electric field E at a point due to a charge configuration is the force on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided by the magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q has a magnitude <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{|q|}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} r^2}  \) </span>; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive, and radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field also satisfies superposition principle.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent at each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that point. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength of electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions of strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is weak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly spaced parallel straight lines.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Some of the important properties of field lines are:<br />
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p> Field lines are continuous curves without any breaks.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Two field lines cannot cross each other.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p> Electrostatic field lines start at positive charges and end at negative charges - they cannot form closed loops. </p>

			Figure (a) shows an uncharged metallic sphere on an insulating metal stand. Bring a negatively charged rod close to the metallic sphere, as shown in Fig. (b). As the rod is brought close to the sphere, the free electrons in the sphere move away due to repulsion and start piling up at the farther end. The near end becomes positively charged due to deficit of electrons. This process of charge distribution stops when the net force on the free electrons inside the metal is zero. Connect the sphere to the ground by a conducting wire. The electrons will flow to the ground while the positive charges at the near end will remain held there due to the attractive force of the negative charges on the rod, as shown in Fig.(c). Disconnect the sphere from the ground. The positive charge continues to be held at the near end [Fig.  (d)]. Remove the electrified rod. The positive charge will spread uniformly over the sphere as shown in Fig.(e). <br />
			In this experiment, the metal sphere gets charged by the process of induction and the rod does not lose any of its charge. <br />
			Similar steps are involved in charging a metal sphere negatively by induction, by bringing a positively charged rod near it. In this case the electrons will flow from the ground to the sphere when the sphere is connected to the ground with a wire. Can you explain why?</p>

		<p>If <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10^9  \) </span> electrons move out of a body to another body every second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C on the other body?<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Solution </span>
			<br />
			In one second <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10^9  \) </span>  electrons move out of the body. <br />
			Therefore the charge given out in one second is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times 10^9 \ C = 1.6 \times 10^{-10} \ C  \) </span>. <br />
			The time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated to be <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  1C \div (1.6 \times 10^{-10} \ C/s) = 6.25 \times 10^9 \ s = 6.25 \times 10^9 \div (365 \times 24 \times 3600) years = 198 \ years  \) </span>.<br />
			Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb, from a body from which <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  10^9  \) </span> electrons move out every second, we will need approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large unit for many practical purposes.<br />
			It is, however, also important to know what is roughly the number of electrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material. A cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  2.5 \times 10^{24}  \) </span> electrons.</p>

		<p>A charged metallic sphere A is suspended by a nylon thread. Another charged metallic sphere B held by an insulating handle is brought close to A such that the distance between their centres is 10 cm, as shown in Fig. (a). The resulting repulsion of A is noted (for example, by shining a beam of light and measuring the deflection of its shadow on a screen). Spheres A and B are touched by uncharged spheres C and D respectively, as shown in Fig (b). C and D are then removed and B is brought closer to A to a distance of 5.0 cm between their centres, as shown in Fig. (c). What is the expected repulsion of A on the basis of Coulomb's law? Spheres A and C and spheres B and D have identical sizes. Ignore the sizes of A and B in comparison to the separation between their centres.</p>

			<br />
			Let the original charge on sphere A be q and that on B be q'. At a distance r between their centres, the magnitude of the electrostatic force on each is given by <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F = \frac{1}{4 \pi epsilon_{0}} \frac{q q'}{r^2}  \) </span>
			<br />
			neglecting the sizes of spheres A and B in comparison to r. When an identical but uncharged sphere C touches A, the charges redistribute on A and C and, by symmetry, each sphere carries a charge <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{q}{2}  \) </span>. Similarly, after D touches B, the redistributed charge on each is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{q'}{2}  \) </span>. Now, if the separation between A and B is halved, the magnitude of the electrostatic force on each is <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F' = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{ \left ( \frac{q}{2} \right ) \left ( \frac{q'}{2} \right ) }{\left ( \frac{r}{2} \right )^2} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{(qq')}{r^2} = F  \) </span>

			<br />
			In Fig.(a) the field is upward, so the negatively charged electron experiences a downward force of magnitude eE where E is the magnitude of the electric field. The acceleration of the electron is <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_e = \frac{eE}{m_e}  \) </span>
			<br />
			where  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  m_e  \) </span> is the mass of the electron. <br />
			Starting from rest, the time required by the electron to fall through a distance h is given by <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  t_e = \sqrt{ \frac{2h}{a_e}} = \sqrt{ \frac{2hm_e}{eE}}  \\\\[3pt]
				For e = 1.6  \times 10^{-19} \ C, \ m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \ kg,  \\\\[3pt]
				E = 2.0 \times 10^4 \ N \ C^{-1}, \ h = 1.5 \times 10^{-2} \ m, \ t_e = 2.9 \times 10^{-9} \ s  \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			In Fig. (b), the field is downward, and the positively charged proton experiences a downward force of magnitude eE. The acceleration of the proton is <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  a_p = \frac{eE}{m_p}  \) </span>
			<br />
			where <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  m_p  \) </span> is the mass of the proton; <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \ kg  \) </span>. The time of fall for the proton is <br />

			<br />
			Thus, the heavier particle (proton) takes a greater time to fall through the same distance. This is in basic contrast to the situation of 'free fall under gravity'’ where the time of fall is independent of the mass of the body. Note that in this example we have ignored the acceleration due to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justified, let us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electric field: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  a_p = \frac{eE}{m_p}  \\\\[3pt]
				= \frac{(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \ C) \times (2.0 \times 10^4 \ N \ C^{-1}}{1.67 \times 10^{-27} \ kg } = 1.9 \times 10^{12} \ m \ s^{-2}   \end{align}  \) </span>
			<br />
			which is enormous compared to the value of g <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   (9.8 \ m \ s^{-2} )  \) </span>, the acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of the electron is even greater. Thus, the effect of acceleration due to gravity can be ignored in this example.</p>
