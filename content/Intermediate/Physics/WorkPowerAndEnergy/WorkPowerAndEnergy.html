		For example, mass, distance, speed, energy, electric flux, current electricity etc. In the above example, current electricity has magnitude and direction both but it is a scalar quantity because two different electrical currents can be added only with simple algebra, as

		<br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Caution </span>
		<br />
		There are two restrictions on using the above equation and to calculate the work done on an object by a force. First the force must be a constant force; that is, it must not change in magnitude or direction as the object moves. Second, the object must be prticle - like. This means that the object must be rigid; all parts of the object must move together in the same direction. </p>

<section class="skill" id="03">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Energy</h3>
	<p>Capacity of a body to do work is called its energy. There are so many types of energy eg, kinetic, potential, electrostatic, magnetic, geothermal, elastic, solar etc. In this chapter we will discuss only mechanical energy. Mechanical energy consists of kinetic energy and potential energy. <br />
		ME = KE + PE <br />
		<span class="highlight01"> Note </span>
		<br />
		KE is always positive but PE may be positive or negative. infact, when forces involved are repulsive, PE is positive and when forces involved are attractive, PE is negative.
	</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Kinetic Energy </h4>
		<p> Kinetic energy is the capacity of the body to do work by virtue of its motion. The faster the object moves, the greater is the kinetic energy. When the object is stationery, its kinetic energy is zero. <br />
			An object of mass m moving in a reference frame with velocity <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \vec{v}  \) </span> (well below the velocity of light ) is said to have kinetic energy given by <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \ \ \ \left [ \frac{1}{2} mv^2 = \frac{1}{2} m(| \vec{v}|)^2 \right ]  \) </span>
			<br />
			Let us consider a constant force F which when acting on a mass at rest, produces velocity v. If on reaching this velocity, the particle has attained an acceleration a and displacement s, then <br />
			by Newton's second law of motion <br />
			F = ma <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v^2 = 2as  \) </span>(By third equation of motion) <br />
			or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  s = \frac{v^2}{2a}  \) </span>
			<br />
			work done by constant force = Fs <br />
			or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  W = ma \left ( \frac{v^2}{2a} \right ) = \frac{1}{2} mv^2  \) </span>
			<br />
			But the kinetic energy of the body is equivalent to the work done in giving the body this velocity. <br />
			Hence,	KE = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{2} mv^2  \) </span>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Vertical Circle</h3>
	<p> In astronomy, a vertical circle is a great circle on the celestial sphere that is perpendicular to the horizon. Therefore it passes through the zenith and the nadir. There is a vertical circle for any given azimuth, where azimuth is the angle measured east from the north on the celestial horizon. The vertical circle which is on the east-west direction is called the prime vertical. The vertical circle which is on the north-south direction is called the Local Celestial Meridian (LCM) or Principal Vertical. Vertical circles are part of the horizontal coordinate system. </p>

<section class="skill" id="06">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Elastic Collisions</h3>
	<p>An elastic collision is an encounter between two bodies in which the total kinetic energy of the two bodies after the encounter is equal to their total kinetic energy before the encounter. Elastic collisions occur only if there is no net conversion of kinetic energy into other forms. <br />
		During the collision of small objects, kinetic energy is first converted to potential energy associated with a repulsive force between the particles (when the particles move against this force, i.e. the angle between the force and the relative velocity is obtuse), then this potential energy is converted back to kinetic energy (when the particles move with this force, i.e. the angle between the force and the relative velocity is acute). <br />
		The collisions of atoms are elastic collisions (Rutherford backscattering is one example). <br />
		The molecules - as distinct from atoms - of a gas or liquid rarely experience perfectly elastic collisions because kinetic energy is exchanged between the molecules translational motion and their internal degrees of freedom with each collision. At any one instant, half the collisions are, to a varying extent, inelastic collisions (the pair possesses less kinetic energy in their translational motions after the collision than before), and half could be described as "super-elastic" (possessing more kinetic energy after the collision than before). Averaged across the entire sample, molecular collisions can be regarded as essentially elastic as long as black-body photons are not permitted to carry away energy from the system. <br />
		In the case of macroscopic bodies, perfectly elastic collisions are an ideal never fully realized, but approximated by the interactions of objects such as billiard balls. <br />
		When considering energies, possible rotational energy before and/or after a collision may also play a role.
	</p>
</section>
<section class="skill" id="07">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">InElastic Collisions</h3>
	<p>An inelastic collision, in contrast to an elastic collision, is a collision in which kinetic energy is not conserved due to the action of internal friction. <br />
		In collisions of macroscopic bodies, some kinetic energy is turned into vibrational energy of the atoms, causing a heating effect, and the bodies are deformed. <br />
		The molecules of a gas or liquid rarely experience perfectly elastic collisions because kinetic energy is exchanged between the molecules' translational motion and their internal degrees of freedom with each collision. At any one instant, half the collisions are - to a varying extent - inelastic (the pair possesses less kinetic energy after the collision than before), and half could be described as "super-elastic" (possessing more kinetic energy after the collision than before). Averaged across an entire sample, molecular collisions are elastic.
	</p>
	<p> Inelastic collisions may not conserve kinetic energy, but they do obey conservation of momentum. Simple ballistic pendulum problems obey the conservation of kinetic energy only when the block swings to its largest angle. <br />
		In nuclear physics, an inelastic collision is one in which the incoming particle causes the nucleus it strikes to become excited or to break up. Deep inelastic scattering is a method of probing the structure of subatomic particles in much the same way as Rutherford probed the inside of the atom (see Rutherford scattering). Such experiments were performed on protons in the late 1960s using high-energy electrons at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC). As in Rutherford scattering, deep inelastic scattering of electrons by proton targets revealed that most of the incident electrons interact very little and pass straight through, with only a small number bouncing back. This indicates that the charge in the proton is concentrated in small lumps, reminiscent of Rutherford's discovery that the positive charge in an atom is concentrated at the nucleus. However, in the case of the proton, the evidence suggested three distinct concentrations of charge (quarks) and not one.

			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  m_b  \) </span> is the mass of the second object <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C_R  \) </span> is the coefficient of restitution; if it is 1 we have an elastic collision; if it is 0 we have a perfectly inelastic collision, see below. <br />

			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  v_a = - C_R u_a  \\\\[6pt]
				v_b = - C_R u_b  \end{align}  \) </span>

<section class="skill" id="08">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Perfectly InElastic Collisions</h3>
	<p> A perfectly inelastic collision occurs when the maximum amount of kinetic energy of a system is lost. In a perfectly inelastic collision, i.e., a zero coefficient of restitution, the colliding particles stick together. In such a collision, kinetic energy is lost by bonding the two bodies together. This bonding energy usually results in a maximum kinetic energy loss of the system. It is necessary to consider conservation of momentum: (Note: In the sliding block example above, momentum of the two body system is only conserved if the surface has zero friction. With friction, momentum of the two bodies is transferred to the surface that the two bodies are sliding upon. Similarly, if there is air resistance, the momentum of the bodies can be transferred to the air.) The equation below holds true for the two-body(Body A, Body B) system collision in the example above. In this example, momentum of the system is conserved because there is no friction between the sliding bodies and the surface. <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  m_a u_a + m_b u_b = \left( m_a + m_b \right) v  \) </span>, <br />
		where v is the final velocity, which is hence given by <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v = \frac{m_a u_a + m_b  u_b}{m_a + m_b}  \) </span>
		<br />
		The reduction of total kinetic energy is equal to the total kinetic energy before the collision in a center of momentum frame with respect to the system of two particles, because in such a frame the kinetic energy after the collision is zero. In this frame most of the kinetic energy before the collision is that of the particle with the smaller mass. In another frame, in addition to the reduction of kinetic energy there may be a transfer of kinetic energy from one particle to the other; the fact that this depends on the frame shows how relative this is.
