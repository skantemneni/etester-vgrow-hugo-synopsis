	<h3 class="skill-heading">Bar Magnet</h3>
	<p> Moving charge and current carrying loop produce magnetism. This phenomenon had been discovered long before, the discovery of magnetic effect of current. The easy source of magnetic field is the bar magnet. A bar magnet has following characteristics : </p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>A freely suspended magnet stays always in north-south direction. The end of the magnet which always rests in the geographical north direction is called the north pole and the end which always rests in the geographical south direction is called the south pole. These poles are represented by the letters N and S respectively. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each other. This repulsion m attraction obeys the inverse-square law. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A magnet attracts some certain materials like iron, steel, cobalt, nickel towards it. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> We cannot isolate the north or south of a magnet. If a bar magnet is sliced into half, we get two smaller bar magnets. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight01"> Magnetic length </span>	 The distance between the two poles of a bar magnet is called magnetic length of the magnet. Magnetic length is a vector from S-pole of the magnet to its N-pole and is denoted by 2 <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \overset{\rightarrow}{I}  \) </span> . Since, the magnetic poles are situated within the magnet, the distance between its two magnetic poles called its magnetic length is always less than its geometric length. <br />

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Coulomb Force</h3>
	<p> Coulomb force, also called electrostatic force or Coulomb interaction,  attraction or repulsion of particles or objects because of their electric charge. One of the basic physical forces, the electric force is named for a French physicist, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who in 1785 published the results of an experimental investigation into the correct quantitative description of this force. <br />
		Two like electric charges, both positive or both negative, repel each other along a straight line between their centres. Two unlike charges, one positive, one negative, attract each other along a straight line joining their centres. The electric force is operative between charges down to distances of at least 10-16 metre, or approximately one-tenth of the diameter of atomic nuclei. Because of their positive charge, protons within nuclei repel each other, but nuclei hold together because of another basic physical force, the strong interaction, or nuclear force, which is stronger than the electric force. Massive, but electrically neutral, astronomical bodies such as planets and stars are bound together in solar systems and galaxies by still another basic physical force, gravitation, which though much weaker than the electric force, is always attractive and is the dominant force at great distances. At distances between these extremes, including the distances of everyday life, the only significant physical force is the electric force in its many varieties along with the related magnetic force. <br />
		The magnitude of the electric force F is directly proportional to the amount of one electric charge, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_1  \) </span>, multiplied by the other, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_2  \) </span>, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance r between their centres. Expressed in the form of an equation, this relation, called Coulomb's law, may be written by including the proportionality factor k as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  F = \frac{k q_1 q_2}{r^2}  \) </span>. In the centimetre-gram-second system of units, the proportionality factor k in a vacuum is set equal to 1 and unit electric charge is defined by Coulomb's law. If an electric force of one unit (one dyne) arises between two equal electric charges one centimetre apart in a vacuum, the amount of each charge is one electrostatic unit, esu, or statcoulomb. In the metre-kilogram-second and the SI systems, the unit of force (newton), the unit of charge (coulomb), and the unit of distance (metre), are all defined independently of Coulomb's law, so the proportionality factor k is constrained to take a value consistent with these definitions, namely, k in a vacuum equals <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  8.98 \times 10^9  \) </span> newton square metre per square coulomb. This choice of value for k permits the practical electrical units, such as ampere and volt, to be included with the common metric mechanical units, such as metre and kilogram, in the same system

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Couple, P.E and Workdone</h3>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Couple </h4>
		<p>A couple is a pair of forces, equal in magnitude, oppositely directed, and displaced by perpendicular distance or moment. <br />
			The simplest kind of couple consists of two equal and opposite forces whose lines of action do not coincide. This is called a "simple couple". The forces have a turning effect or moment called a torque about an axis which is normal (perpendicular) to the plane of the forces. The SI unit for the torque of the couple is newton metre. <br />
			If the two forces are F and -F, then the magnitude of the torque is given by the following formula: <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \tau = F d  \) </span>
			<br />
			where <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \tau  \) </span> is the torque <br />
			F is the magnitude of one of the forces <br />
			d is the perpendicular distance between the forces, sometimes called the arm of the couple <br />
			The magnitude of the torque is always equal to F d, with the direction of the torque given by the unit vector <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \hat{e}  \) </span>, which is perpendicular to the plane containing the two forces. When d is taken as a vector between the points of action of the forces, then the couple is the cross product of d and F. i.e., <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \tau = d \times F  \) </span>
		</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Potential Energy </h4>
		<p>The energy of a magnetic moment m in an externally produced magnetic B-field B has potential energy <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  U = - m \cdot B  \) </span>
			<br />
			The magnetization M in a field is <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  U = - \frac{1}{2} \int M \cdot B dV  \) </span>, <br />
			where the integral can be over all space or, equivalently, where M is nonzero. Magnetic potential energy is the form of energy related not only to the distance between magnetic materials, but also to the orientation, or alignment, of those materials within the field. For example, the needle of a compass has the lowest magnetic potential energy when it is aligned with the north and south poles of the Earth's magnetic field. If the needle is moved by an outside force, torque is exerted on the magnetic dipole of the needle by the Earth's magnetic field, causing it to move back into alignment. The magnetic potential energy of the needle is highest when its field is in the same direction as the Earth's magnetic field. Two magnets will have potential energy in relation to each other and the distance between them, but this also depends on their orientation. If the opposite poles are held apart, the potential energy will be the highest when they are near the edge of their attraction, and the lowest when they pull together. Conversely, like poles will have the highest potential energy when forced together, and the lowest when they spring apart.

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Work Done </h4>
		<p> In the first three units of The Physics Classroom, we utilized Newton's laws to analyze the motion of objects. Force and mass information were used to determine the acceleration of an object. Acceleration information was subsequently used to determine information about the velocity or displacement of an object after a given period of time. In this manner, Newton's laws serve as a useful model for analyzing motion and making predictions about the final state of an object's motion. In this unit, an entirely different model will be used to analyze the motion of objects. Motion will be approached from the perspective of work and energy. The effect that work has upon the energy of an object (or system of objects) will be investigated; the resulting velocity and/or height of the object can then be predicted from energy information. In order to understand this work-energy approach to the analysis of motion, it is important to first have a solid understanding of a few basic terms. <br />
			When a force acts upon an object to cause a displacement of the object, it is said that work was done upon the object. There are three key ingredients to work - force, displacement, and cause. In order for a force to qualify as having done work on an object, there must be a displacement and the force must cause the displacement. There are several good examples of work that can be observed in everyday life - a horse pulling a plow through the field, a father pushing a grocery cart down the aisle of a grocery store, a freshman lifting a backpack full of books upon her shoulder, a weightlifter lifting a barbell above his head, an Olympian launching the shot-put, etc. In each case described here there is a force exerted upon an object to cause that object to be displaced.

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Time Period Of Oscillations</h3>
	<p> The period of swing of a simple gravity pendulum depends on its length, the local strength of gravity, and to a small extent on the maximum angle that the pendulum swings away from vertical, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \theta_0  \) </span>, called the amplitude. It is independent of the mass of the bob. If the amplitude is limited to small swings, the period T of a simple pendulum, the time taken for a complete cycle, is <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  T \approx 2 \pi \sqrt{ \frac{L}{g}} \ \ \ \ \ \theta_0 \ll  (1)  \) </span>
		<br />
		where L is the length of the pendulum and g is the local acceleration of gravity. <br />
		For small swings the period of swing is approximately the same for different size swings that is, the period is independent of amplitude. This property, called isochronism, is the reason pendulums are so useful for timekeeping. Successive swings of the pendulum, even if changing in amplitude, take the same amount of time. <br />
		For larger amplitudes, the period increases gradually with amplitude so it is longer than given by equation (1). For example, at an amplitude of <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \theta_0 = 23^{\circ}  \) </span> it is 1% larger than given by (1). The period increases asymptotically (to infinity) as <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \theta_0  \) </span> approaches <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  180^{\circ}  \) </span>, because the value <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \theta_0 = 180^{\circ}  \) </span> is an unstable equilibrium point for the pendulum. The true period of an ideal simple gravity pendulum can be written in several different forms (see Pendulum (mathematics) ), one example being the infinite series: <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  T = 2 \pi \sqrt{L \over g} \left ( 1+ \frac{1}{16} \theta_0^2 + \frac{11}{3072}\theta_0^4 + \cdots \right )  \) </span>
		<br />
		For small swings the pendulum approximates a harmonic oscillator, and its motion as a function of time, t, is approximately simple harmonic motion: <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \theta (t) = \theta_0 \cos \left ( \frac{2 \pi}{T} t + \varphi \right )  \) </span>
		<br />
		where <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \varphi  \) </span> is a constant value, dependent on initial conditions. <br />
		For real pendulums, corrections to the period may be needed to take into account the buoyancy and viscous resistance of the air, the mass of the string or rod, the size and shape of the bob and how it is attached to the string, flexibility and stretching of the string, and motion of the support.

		<h4 class="skill-subheading"> Earth's Magnetism </h4>
		<p> A freely suspended magnet always points in the north-south direction even in the absence of any other magnet. This suggests that the earth itself behaves as a magnet which causes a freely suspended magnet (or magnetic needle) to point always in a particular direction : north and south. The shape of earth's magnetic field resembles that of a bar magnet of length one-fifth of earth's diameter buried at its centre. </p>

		<p> The south pole of earth's magnet is towards earth's north pole (geographical north), while the north pole of earth's magnet is towards  earth's south pole (geographical south). Thus, there is a magnetic S-pole near the geographical north, and a magnetic N-pole near the geographical south. The positions of the earth's magnetic poles are not well defined on the globe, they are spread over an area. <br />

					<p>In either case, one gets two magnets, each with a north and south pole.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>No force if the field is uniform. The iron nail experiences a nonuniform field due to the bar magnet. There is induced magnetic moment in the nail, therefore, it experiences both force and torque. The net force is attractive because the induced south pole (say) in the nail is closer to the north pole of magnet than induced north pole.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Not necessarily. True only if the source of the field has a net nonzero magnetic moment. This is not so for a toroid or even for a straight infinite conductor.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Try to bring different ends of the bars closer. A repulsive force in some situation establishes that both are magnetised. If it is always attractive, then one of them is not magnetised. In a bar magnet the intensity of the magnetic field is the strongest at the two ends (poles) and weakest at the central region. This fact may be used to determine whether A or B is the magnet. In this case, to see which one of the two bars is a magnet, pick up one, (say, A) and lower one of its ends; first on one of the ends of the other (say, B), and then on the middle of B. If you notice that in the middle of B, A experiences no force, then B is magnetised. If you do not notice any change from the end to the middle of B, then A is magnetised.</p>

				<li>
					<p>Wrong. Magnetic field lines can never emanate from a point, as shown in figure. Over any closed surface, the net flux of B must always be zero, i.e., pictorially as many field lines should seem to enter the surface as the number of lines leaving it. The field lines shown, in fact, represent electric field of a long positively charged wire. The correct magnetic field lines are circling the straight conductor, </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Wrong. Magnetic field lines (like electric field lines) can never cross each other, because otherwise the direction of field at the point of intersection is ambiguous. There is further error in the figure. Magnetostatic field lines can never form closed loops around empty space. A closed loop of static magnetic field line must enclose a region across which a current is passing. By contrast, electrostatic field lines can never form closed loops, neither in empty space, nor when the loop encloses charges.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Right. Magnetic lines are completely confined within a toroid. Nothing wrong here in field lines forming closed loops, since each loop encloses a region across which a current passes. Note, for clarity of figure, only a few field lines within the toroid have been shown. Actually, the entire region enclosed by the windings contains magnetic field.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Wrong. Field lines due to a solenoid at its ends and outside cannot be so completely straight and confined; such a thing violates Ampere's law. The lines should curve out at both ends, and meet eventually to form closed loops.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Right. These are field lines outside and inside a bar magnet. Note carefully the direction of field lines inside. Not all field lines emanate out of a north pole (or converge into a south pole). Around both the N-pole, and the S-pole, the net flux of the field is zero.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Wrong. These field lines cannot possibly represent a magnetic field. Look at the upper region. All the field lines seem to emanate out of the shaded plate. The net flux through a surface surrounding the shaded plate is not zero. This is impossible for a magnetic field. The given field lines, in fact, show the electrostatic field lines around a positively charged upper plate and a negatively charged lower plate. The difference between Fig. [(e) and (f)] should be carefully grasped.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Wrong. Magnetic field lines between two pole pieces cannot be precisely straight at the ends. Some fringing of lines is inevitable. Otherwise, Ampere’s law is violated. This is also true for electric field lines.</p>

				<li>
					<p>No. The magnetic force is always normal to B (remember magnetic force = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  qv \times B  \) </span>). It is misleading to call magnetic field lines as lines of force.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If field lines were entirely confined between two ends of a straight solenoid, the flux through the cross-section at each end would be non-zero. But the flux of field B through any closed surface must always be zero. For a toroid, this difficulty is absent because it has no 'ends'.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Gauss's law of magnetism states that the flux of B through any closed surface is always zero <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \oint_s B .ds = 0  \) </span> If monopoles existed, the right hand side would be equal to the monopole (magnetic charge) <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  q_m  \) </span> enclosed by S.

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>No. There is no force or torque on an element due to the field produced by that element itself. But there is a force (or torque) on an element of the same wire. (For the special case of a straight wire, this force is zero.)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Yes. The average of the charge in the system may be zero. Yet, the mean of the magnetic moments due to various current loops may not be zero. We will come across such examples in connection with paramagnetic material where atoms have net dipole moment through their net charge is zero.</p>
