	<p> An antenna is basically a conductor of small length which is used to radiate or receive electromagnetic waves. At the transmitting end, it helps to convert high frequency current into electromagnetic waves. At the receiving end, it helps to transform electromagnetic waves into original electrical signal.</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Modulation</h4>
		<p> The phenomenon of superposition of information signal over a high frequency carrier wave is called modulation. In this process. amplitude, frequency or phase angle of a high frequency carrier wave is modified in accordance with the instantaneous value of the low frequency information. </p>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Need For Modulation</h5>
		<p> Digital and analog signals to be transmitted are usually of low frequency and hence, cannot be transmitted as such. These signals require some carrier to be transported.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Frequency of Signal </span> The audio frequency signals (20 Hz to 20 kHz) cannot be transmitted without distortion over long distances due to less energy carried by low frequency audio waves. The energy of a wave is directly proportional to square of its frequency Even if the audio signal is converted into electrical signal. the later cannot be sent very far without employing large amount of power.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Height of antenna </span> For efficient radiation and reception, the height of transmitting and receiving antennas should be comparable to a quarter wavelength of the frequency used. <br />
						<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  Wavelength = \frac{velocity}{frequency} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{frequency(Hz)} metre \) </span>
						<br />
						For 1 MHz it is 75 m for 15 kHz frequency. the height of antennas has to be about 5000 m which size is unthinkable.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight01">Number of channels </span> Audio frequencies are concentrated in the range 20Hz to 20 kHz. This range is sc narrow that there will be overlapping of signals. In order tc separate the various signals it is necessary to convert all of then: to different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>

					<p>Electronic communication refers to the faithful transfer of information or message (available in the form of electrical voltage and current) from one point to another point.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Transmitter, transmission channel and receiver are three basic units of a communication system.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Two important forms of communication system are: Analog and Digital. The information to be transmitted is generally in continuous waveform for the former while for the latter it has only discrete or quantised levels.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Every message signal occupies a range of frequencies. The bandwidth of a message signal refers to the band of frequencies, which are necessary for satisfactory transmission of the information contained in the signal. Similarly, any practical communication system permits transmission of a range of frequencies only, which is referred to as the bandwidth of the system.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Low frequencies cannot be transmitted to long distances. Therefore, they are superimposed on a high frequency carrier signal by a process known as modulation.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In modulation, some characteristic of the carrier signal like amplitude, frequency or phase varies in accordance with the modulating or message signal. Correspondingly, they are called Amplitude Modulated (AM), Frequency Modulated (FM) or Phase Modulated (PM) waves.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Pulse modulation could be classified as: Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), Pulse Duration Modulation (PDM) or Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Pulse Position Modulation (PPM).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>For transmission over long distances, signals are radiated into space using devices called antennas. The radiated signals propagate as electromagnetic waves and the mode of propagation is influenced by the presence of the earth and its atmosphere. Near the surface of the earth, electromagnetic waves propagate as surface waves. Surface wave propagation is useful up to a few MHz frequencies.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Long distance communication between two points on the earth is achieved through reflection of electromagnetic waves by ionosphere. Such waves are called sky waves. Sky wave propagation takes place up to frequency of about 30 MHz. Above this frequency, electromagnetic waves essentially propagate as space waves. Space waves are used for line-of-sight communication and satellite communication.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If an antenna radiates electromagnetic waves from a height <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  h_T  \) </span>, then the range dT is given by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \sqrt{2Rh_T}  \) </span> where R is the radius of the earth.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Amplitude modulated signal contains frequencies <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (\omega_c - \omega_m)  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (\omega_c + \omega_m)  \) </span>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Amplitude modulated waves can be produced by application of the message signal and the carrier wave to a non-linear device, followed by a band pass filter.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>AM detection, which is the process of recovering the modulating signal from an AM waveform, is carried out using a rectifier and an envelope detector.</p>
