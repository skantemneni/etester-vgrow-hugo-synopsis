	<h3 class="skill-heading">Kinetic Theory Of an Ideal Gas</h3>
	<p>The kinetic theory of gases correlates the macroscopic properties of gases eg, pressure, temperature etc to the microscopic properties of gas molecules eg, speed, momentum, kinetic energy of molecules etc. The kinetic theory of gases is based on the following assumptions</p>
	<div class="list-custom-block-list-ol spaced20 indented20">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p> A gas consists of a large number of tiny, identical, spherical and electrically neutral, stable elastic particles called molecules. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The space occupied by the molecules of a gas is extremely small as compared to the volume of the gas.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The molecules of a gas are in a state of continuous, random motion with all possible speeds ranging from zero to infinity in different possible directions. The speed distribution is in accordance with Maxwell's distribution law of molecular speeds and has been shown in figure. <br/>

					 </div>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Each molecule behaves as an independent entity. There is no force of attraction among the molecules. Thus, gas molecules have no potential energy but possess only kinetic energy which is directly proportional to temperature of the gas. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The pressure of a gas is due to elastic collision of gas molecules with the walls of the container. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The dynamics of the particles is governed by Newton's laws of motion. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> The time of contact of a moving molecule with the container walls at the time of collision is negligible as compared to the time between two successive collisions with the same wall of the container. </p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>On the basis of these assumptions we can do mathematical calculations to find expression for pressure exerted by a gas. <br/>
		accordingly, we find that <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  pV = \frac{1}{3}m N(\bar{v})^2  \) </span>, where m = mass of gas molecule and N = total number of gas molecules, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \bar{v}  \) </span> is as root mean square velocity <br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v_{rms} = \bar{v} = \left [ \frac{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + ..... + v_N^2}{N} \right ]^{\frac{1}{2}}  \) </span>
		<br/>
		Thus, pressure exerted by a gas <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  p = \frac{1}{3} \frac{mN}{V} \bar{v}^2 = \frac{1}{3} \rho \bar{v}^2  \) </span>, <br/>
		where, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \rho = \frac{mN}{V}  \) </span> = density of given gas. <br/>
		Now <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  p = \frac{1}{3} m \left( \frac{N}{V} \right ) \bar{v}^2 = \frac{2}{3} \frac{N}{V} \left ( \frac{1}{2} m \bar{v}^2 \right )  \) </span>
		<br/>
		or <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  pV = \frac{2}{3} N \overline{KE}  \) </span>
		<br/>
		Also <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  p = \frac{1}{3} \rho \bar{v}^2 = \frac{2}{3} \left ( \frac{1}{2} \rho \bar{v}^2 \right )  \) </span>
		<br/>
		now <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{2} \rho \bar{v}^2  \) </span> = average kinetic energy of the gas per unit volume <br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \therefore p = \frac{2}{3} \times  \) </span> average kinetic energy per unit volume <br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  p = \frac{2}{3} E  \) </span>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Various Speeds Of Gas Molecules</h3>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01"> Root mean square (rms) speed</span> It is defined as the square root of the mean of squares of the speeds of different molecules ie, <br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v_{rms} = \bar{v} = \sqrt{ \frac{(v_1^2 + v_2^2 + .... + v_N^2)}{N}}  \) </span>
		<br/>
		According to kinetic theory of gases it is observed that <br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v_{rms} = \bar{v} = \sqrt{ \frac{3p}{\rho}} = \sqrt{ \frac{3pV}{mass}} = \sqrt{ \frac{3RT}{M}} = \sqrt{ \frac{3kT}{m}}  \) </span>
		<br/>
		where, M is the molar mass of gas while in is the mass of a single gas molecule. <br/>
		<span class="highlight01"> Average speed </span> It is the arithmetic mean of the speeds of molecules in a gas. Thus, <br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v_{av} = \bar{v} = \frac{v_1 + v_2 + ..... + v_N}{N}  \) </span>
		<br/>
		On the basis of kinetic theory it is observed that <br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v_{av} = \sqrt{ \frac{8RT}{ \pi M}} = \sqrt{ \frac{8p}{\pi \rho}} = \sqrt{ \frac{8kT}{\pi m}}  \) </span>
		<br/>
		<span class="highlight01">Most probable speed </span> It is the speed possessed by maximun number of gas molecules in a given gas. On kinetic theory basis it is found that <br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  v_{mp} = \sqrt{ \frac{2RT}{M}} = \sqrt{ \frac{2kT}{m}} = \sqrt{ \frac{2p}{\rho}}  \) </span>
		<br/>
		Thus, we find that for a given gas <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V_{mp} &lt; V_{av} &lt; \bar{v}  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  V_{mp} : V_{av} : \bar{V} =	\sqrt{2} : \sqrt{ \frac{8}{\pi}} : \sqrt{3}  \) </span>

			<br />
			For a given mass of water molecules, the density is less if volume is large. So the volume of the vapour is <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1000}{0.6} = (6 \times 10^{-4})  \) </span> times larger. If densities of bulk water and water molecules are same, then the fraction of molecular volume to the total volume in liquid state is 1.

			<br />
			Using the gas law <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  PV = \mu RT  \) </span>, you can easily show that 1 mol of any (ideal) gas at standard temperature (273 K) and pressure <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (1 atm = 1.01 \times 10^5 \ Pa)  \) </span> occupies a volume of 22.4 litres. This universal volume is called molar volume. Thus the cylinder in this example contains 2 mol of helium. Further, since helium is monatomic, its predicted (and observed) molar specific heat at constant volume, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C_v = \left (\frac{3}{2} \right ) R  \) </span>,  and molar specific heat at constant pressure, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  C_p = \left (\frac{3}{2} \right ) R + R = \left (\frac{5}{2} \right ) R  \) </span>.

			<br />
			(a) Let the speed of the ball be u relative to the wicket behind the bat. If the bat is moving towards the ball with a speed V relative to the wicket, then the relative speed of the ball to bat is V + u towards the bat. When the ball rebounds (after hitting the massive bat) its speed, relative to bat, is V + u moving away from the bat. So relative to the wicket the speed of the rebounding ball is V + (V + u) = 2V + u, moving away from the wicket.<br />
			So the ball speeds up after the collision with the bat. The rebound speed will be less than u if the bat is not massive. For a molecule this would imply an increase in temperature. <br />

			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight01">Solution</span>
			<br />
			The important point to remember is that the average kinetic energy (per molecule) of any (ideal) gas (be it monatomic like argon, diatomic like chlorine or polyatomic) is always equal to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left( \frac{3}{2} \right ) k_B \ T  \) </span> . It depends only on temperature, and is independent of the nature of the gas.<br />
			Since argon and chlorine both have the same temperature in the flask, the ratio of average kinetic energy (per molecule) of the two gases is 1:1.<br />
			Now <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{1}{2} m v_{rms} \ 2  \) </span> = average kinetic energy per molecule = <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( \frac{3}{2} \right) k_B \ T  \) </span> where m is the mass of a molecule of the gas. Therefore, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{{v_{rms}}^2}{{v_{rms}}^2} = \frac{m_{Cl}}{m_{Ar}} = \frac{M_{Cl}}{M_{Ar}} = \frac{70.9}{39.9} = 1.77  \) </span>
			<br />
			where M denotes the molecular mass of the gas. (For argon, a molecule is just an atom of argon.) Taking square root of both sides, <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{v_{rms}}{v_{rms}} = 1.33 \) </span>
			<br />
			You should note that the composition of the mixture by mass is quite irrelevant to the above <br />
			calculation. Any other proportion by mass of argon and chlorine would give the same answers to (i) and (ii), provided the temperature remains unaltered.</p>
