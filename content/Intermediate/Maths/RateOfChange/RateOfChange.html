	<h3 class="skill-heading">The Derivative as a rate of Change</h3>
	<p>In case of a linear function y = mx + b the graph is a straight line and the slope m measures the steepness of the line by giving the rate of climb of the line. the rate of change of y with respect to x. </p>
	<p>As x changes from <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  x_0  \) </span> to <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  x_1  \) </span>, y changes m times as much: <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  y_1 - y_0 = m(x_1 - x_0) \) </span>
		<br />
		Thus the slope <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  m = \frac{(y_1 - y_0)}{(x_1 - x_0)}  \) </span> gives the change in y per unit change in x.</p>
	<p>In more general case of differentiable function y = f(x), the differential quotient <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{x + h - x} = \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}, \ h \neq 0 \) </span>
		<br />
		give the average rate of change of y (or f) with respect to x. The limit as h approaches zero is the derivative <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x) \) </span>, which can interpreted as the <i> instantaneous rate of change </i> of y with respect to x. Since the graph is a curve, the rate of change of y can vary from point to point.</p>

		<p> Suppose that an object is moving along a straight line and that, for each time t during a certain time interval, the object has (coordinate) x(t). Then at time t + h, the position of the object is x(t + h), and x(t + h) - x(t) is the change in position that the object experienced during the time period t to t + h. The ratio <br />

			gives the average velocity of the object during this time period. If <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \lim \limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{x(t + h) - x(t)}{h} = x'(t)  \) </span>
			<br />
			exists, then <i>x'(t)</i> gives the (instantaneous) rate of change of position with respect to time. This rate of change of position is called the <i> velocity </i> of the object. If the velocity function is itself differentiable, then its rate of change with respect to time is called the <i>acceleration</i>; in symbols<br />

			<br />
			If the velocity and acceleration have the same sign then the object is speeding up, but if the velocity and acceleration have opposite signs then the object is slowing down.<br />
			A sudden change in acceleration is called a <i>jerk</i>. <i>Jerk</i> is the derivative of acceleration. If a body's position at the time t is x(t), the body's jerk at time t is <br />

			The area A of a circle with radius r is given by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  A = \pi r^2  \) </span>. Therefore, the rate of change of the area A with respect to its radius r is given by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \frac{dA}{dr} 9\pi r^2) = 2 \pi r  \) </span>

		<p>A stone is dropped into a quiet lake and waves move in circles at a speed of 4cm per second. At the instant, when the radius of the circular wave is 10 cm, how fast is the enclosed area increasing? <br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Solution </span>
			<br />
			The area A of a circle with radius r is given by <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  A = \pi r^2  \) </span>. Therefore, the rate of change of area A with respect to time t is<br />
