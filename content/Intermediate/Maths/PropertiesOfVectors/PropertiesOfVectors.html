	<h3 class="skill-heading">Introduction</h3>
	<p>A vector is a quantity having both magnitude and direction, such as displacement, velocity, force and acceleration.</p>
	<p>Any portion of a straight line, where the two end-points are distinguished as initial and terminal, is called a directed line segment. The directed line segment with initial point A and terminal point B is denoted by the symbol <span class="highlight01">AB.</span>
		<br />
		Graphically, a vector is represented by a directed line segment. We denote it by a letter with an arrow over it, as in<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \overrightarrow{a} \) </span>, or in bold type, as in <span class="highlight01">a.</span>
		<br />
		A scalar is a quantity having magnitude only but no direction, such as mass, length, time, temperature and any real number.
	</p>
	<p>A vector whose initial and terminal points are the same is called a zero vector,<span class="highlight01">0</span>.</p>
	<p>The <span class="highlight01">position vector r</span> or any point P with respect to the origin of reference O is a vector <span class="highlight01">OP</span> A point with position vector <span class="highlight01">r</span> will be written as P<span class="highlight01">(r)</span>.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="highlight01">Equal vectors</span> Two vectors (<span class="highlight01">a</span> and <span class="highlight01">b</span>) are said to be equal they have equal magnitude, <span class="highlight01">a</span> and <span class="highlight01">b</span> lie on the same line on parallel lines and, <span class="highlight01">a</span> and <span class="highlight01">b</span> have the same direction. <span class="highlight01">Unit vectors</span> A vector whose magnitude is of unit length. <br />
		unit vector in the direction of <span class="highlight01">a</span> is  <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \frac{a}{|a|}  \) </span>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Collinear vectors</h3>
	<p>Two vectors a and <span class="highlight01">b</span> are said to be <span class="highlight01">collinear</span> if they are supported on the same or parallel lines. For such vectors, <span class="highlight01">b = xa</span> for some scalar x.
		<br />
		Three or more points <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( P_1, \ P_2, \ P_3,..., \) </span> are said to be collinear if they lie on a single straight line L. A line on which points lie, especially if it is related to a geometric figure such as a triangle, is sometimes called an axis.<br />
		Two points are trivially collinear since two points determine a line.<br />
		Three points <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( x_i=(x_i,y_i,z_i) \) </span> for i=1, 2, 3 are collinear if the ratios of distances satisfy<br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( x_2-x_1:y_2-y_1:z_2-z_1=x_3-x_1:y_3-y_1:z_3-z_1 \) </span>.

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Coplanar vectors</h3>
	<p>A set of vectors is said to be <span class="highlight01">coplanar</span> if they lie on the same plane, or the planes in which the different vectors lie are all parallel to the same plane. Three vectors a, b and c are coplanar if <span class="highlight01">c = xa + yb</span> for some scalars x and y.</p>
	<p>In three-dimensional space, two independent vectors with the same initial point determine a plane through that point. Their cross product is a normal vector to that plane, and any vector orthogonal to this cross product through the initial point will lie in the plane. This leads to the following coplanarity test. Four distinct points, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( x_1, \ x_2, \ x_3 \ and \ x_4 \) </span> are coplanar if and only if,<br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  (x_3 - x_1) \cdot [(x_2 - x_1) \times (x_4 - x_3)] = 0. \) </span>
		<br />
		If three vectors a, b and c are coplanar, then<br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( (c \cdot \hat{a}) \hat{a} + (c \cdot \hat{b}) \hat {b}  = c  \) </span>, <br />
		where <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \hat{a}  \) </span> denotes the unit vector in the direction of <span class="highlight01"> a </span>. That is, the vector projections of <span class="highlight01"> c </span> on <span class="highlight01"> a </span> and <span class="highlight01"> c </span> on <span class="highlight01"> b </span> add to give the original <span class="highlight01"> c </span>.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Vector Functions of a Vector Variable</h3>
	<p>A vector function F is a mathematical rule of correspondence, expressed via Y = F(X), which assigns to each vector X in a region <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( D(F) \subset R^n \) </span>, called the domain of the function F, a vector Y in <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( R^m \) </span>. The set of all vectors thus obtained as X varies in D(F) is the range of F, denoted by R(F). When it is not necessary to specify D(F) or R(F) precisely, we can write <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( F : R^n \rightarrow R^m \) </span> to indicate the dimensions of the vectors involved.</p>
	<p>The vector equation <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( Y = F(X) \) </span>
		<br/>
		is a mathematical "shorthand" expression for the more detailed relationships satisfied by the components of X and Y :<br/>
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align} y_1 = f_1(x_1, \ x_2, \ ..., \ x_n)  \\\\[3pt]
			y_2 = f_2(x_1, \ x_2, \ ..., \ x_n)  \\\\[3pt]
			. \\\\[3pt]
			. \\\\[3pt]

			y_m = f_m(x_1, \ x_2, \ ..., \ x_n) \end{align}  \) </span>
