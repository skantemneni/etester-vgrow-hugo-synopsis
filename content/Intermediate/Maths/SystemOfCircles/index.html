					<i>Coaxal Circles</i> A system of circle is said to be coaxal if every pair of circles of the system have the same radical axis.<br />
					<i>The simplest form</i> of the equation of a coaxal system of circles is <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + c = 0  \) </span> where g is a variable and c is constant, the common radical axis of the system being y-axis and the line of centres being x-axis. <br />
					<i>The Limiting points</i> of the coaxal system of circles are the members of the system which are of zero radius. Thus the limiting points of the coaxal system of circles <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + c = 0  \) </span> are <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( ( \pm \sqrt{c}, \ 0)  \) </span> if <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( c \geq 0  \) </span>
					<br />
					The equation <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( S + \lambda S'= 0 \ ( \lambda \neq -1) \) </span> represents a family of coaxal circles, two of whose members are given to be S = 0 and S' = 0.<br />
					<i>Conjugate systems (or orthogonal systems) of circles</i> Two system of circles such that every circle of one system cuts every circle of the other system orthogonally are said to be conjugate system of circles. For instance, <br />
					<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + c = 0  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( x^2 + y^2 + 2fy - c = 0  \) </span>
					<br />
					where g and f are variables and c is constant, represent two systems of coaxal circles which are conjugate.</p>
