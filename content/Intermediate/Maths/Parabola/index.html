	<p>A conic (or a conic section) is the locus of a point which moves in a plane such that its distance from a fixed point bears a constant ratio to its distance from a fixed line. <br />
		The fixed point is called a focus and the fixed line is called a directrix of the conic. The constant ratio is known as the eccentricity of the conic and is denoted by the letter e. The conic is an <i>ellipse</i>, a <i>parabola</i> or a <i>hyperbola</i>, according as e &lt; = or &gt; 1. </p>
