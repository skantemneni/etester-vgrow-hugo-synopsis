	<h3 class="skill-heading">Rotation of Axes</h3>
	<p> If the axes are rotated through an angle <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \theta  \) </span> in the anticlockwise direction keeping the origin fixed, then the coordinates <span class="highlight01">(X, Y)</span> of a point <span class="highlight01">P(x, y)</span> with respect to the new system of coordinate are given by <br />
		<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  X = x \ cos \ \theta + y \ sin \ \theta \ and \ Y = y \ cos \ \theta - x \ sin \ \theta  \) </span>.</p>

<section class="skill" id="02">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Translation of Axes</h3>
	<p> The shifting the origin of axes without rotation of axes is called <i>Translation of axes</i>. <br />
		If the origin (0, 0) is shifted to the point <span class="highlight01">(h, k)</span> without rotation of the axes then the coordinates <span class="highlight01">(X, Y)</span> of a point <span class="highlight01">P(x, y)</span> with respect to the new system of coordinates are given by X = x - h, Y = y - k. </p>
