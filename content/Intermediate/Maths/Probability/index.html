				<p>A random experiment is an experiment in which (i) all the outcomes of the experiment are known in advance, and (ii) the exact outcome of any specific performance of the experiment is unpredictable, i.e., not known in advance.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A sample space, denoted by S, associated with a random experiment is a set of points such that (i) each element of S denotes an outcome of the experiment, and (ii) any performance of the experiment results in an outcome that corresponds to exactly one element of S. In other words, sample space consists of all possible outcomes associated with the random experiment.<br />
					The element of the sample space associated with a random experiment are called the elementary or simple or indecomposable events of that experiment.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>An event (associated with a random experiment) is a subset of the sample space S (associated with that experiment). We say that an event <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( E(\subseteq S) \) </span> has occurred provided the outcome <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \omega \) </span> of the experiment is an element of E. If the outcome <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \omega \) </span> of the experiment is such that <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \omega \notin \) </span> E, we say that the event E has not occurred.<br />
					The empty set <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( \varnothing \) </span>, which is a subset of every set, also represents an event and is said to be an impossible event. The set S is itself a subset of S and it represents the sure event.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>A set of events is said to be mutually exclusive if the occurrence of one of them precludes the occurrence of any of the remaining events. In set-theoretic notation, events <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( E_1, E_2,.....E_m  \) </span>are mutually exclusive if <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( E_i \cap E_j =  \varnothing  \) </span> for <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( i \neq j  \) </span> and <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( 1 \leq i, j \leq m  \) </span>.

				<p>A set of events is said to be equally likely if, taking into consideration all the relevant factors, there is no reason to expect one of them in preference to the others.</p>

	<h3 class="skill-heading">Independent Events</h3>
	<p>We say that two events A and B are independent if the occurrence or non-occurrence of A(B) does not affect the probability of occurrence or non-occurrence of B(A), that is, if P(B | A) = P(B) provided <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( P(A) \neq 0  \) </span>

		<br />
		If two events are not independent, they are said to be dependent.<br />
		We note that if P(A) = 0 then for any event B, <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  0 \leq P (A \cap B) \leq P(A) = 0, \) </span> so that <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B)  \) </span> and A is independent of any other event.<br />
		Difference between Mutual Exclusiveness and Independence <br />
		We advise the reader to distinguish between independent and mutually exclusive events. Independence is a property of probability, whereas mutual exclusion is a set-theoretic property. If A and B are mutually exclusive events with P(A) > 0 and P(B) > 0, then <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P(A \cap B) = 0 \neq P(A) P(B),  \) </span> so that A and B cannot he independent. In fact,P(A | B) = 0 = P(B | A).so that if A occurs,B cannot occur and vice versa. Thus A and B are strongly dependent when <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  A \cap B = \varnothing. \) </span>

		<p>An urn contains 10 black and 5 white balls. Two balls are drawn from the urn one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that both drawn balls are black?<br />
			<span class="highlight01"> Solution </span>
			<br />
			Let E and F denote respectively the events that first and second ball drawn are black. We have to find <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  P(E \cap F)  \) </span> or P (EF). <br />
			P(E) = P (black ball in first draw) <span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(   = \frac{10}{15}  \) </span>
			<br />
			Also given that the first ball drawn is black, i.e., event E has occurred, now there are 9 black balls and five white balls left in the urn. Therefore, the probability that the second ball drawn is black, given that the ball in the first draw is black, is nothing but the conditional probability of F given that E has occurred. <br />
			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \left ( \frac{F}{E} \right ) = \frac{9}{14}  \) </span>

			<span class=\"latex\" lang=\"latex\"> \(  \begin{align}  P(E \cap F) = P(E)\left ( \frac{F}{E} \right )  \\\\[3pt]

			<i> Multiplication rule of probability for more than two events </i> If E, F and G are three events of sample space, we have <br />
