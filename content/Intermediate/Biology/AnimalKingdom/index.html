<p>When you look around, you will observe different animals with different structures and forms. As over a million species of animals have been described till now, the need for classification becomes all the more important. The classification also helps in assigning a systematic position to newly described species.</p>
<section class="skill" id="01">
	<h3 class="skill-heading">Basis of Classification</h3>
	<p>Inspite of differences in structure and form of different animals, there are fundamental features common to various individuals in relation to the arrangement of cells, body symmetry, nature of coelom, patterns of digestive, circulatory or reproductive systems. These features are used as the basis of animal classification and some of them are discussed here.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Levels of Organisation</h4>
		<p>Though all members of Animalia are multicellular, all of them do not exhibit the same pattern of organisation of cells. For example, in sponges, the cells are arranged as loose cell aggregates, i.e., they exhibit <b>cellular level</b> of organisation. Some division of labour (activities) occur among the cells. In coelenterates, the arrangement of cells is more complex. Here the cells performing the same function are arranged into tissues, hence is called <b>tissue level</b> of organisation. A still higher level of organisation, i.e., <b>organ level</b> is exhibited by members of Platyhelminthes and other higher phyla where tissues are grouped together to form organs, each specialised for a particular function. In animals like Annelids, Arthropods, Molluscs, Echinoderms and Chordates, organs have associated to form functional systems, each system concerned with a specific physiological function. This pattern is called <b>organ system</b> level of organisation. Organ systems in different groups of animals exhibit various patterns of complexities. For example, the digestive system in Platyhelminthes has only a single opening to the outside of the body that serves as both mouth and anus, and is hence called incomplete. A complete digestive system has two openings, mouth and anus. Similarly, the circulatory system may be of two types:</p>
		<div class="list1-ol default-spaced-indented list-numbered-style-lower-alpha">
			<ol type="i">
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>open type</b> in which the blood is pumped out of the heart and the cells and tissues are directly bathed in it and</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>closed type</b> in which the blood is circulated through a series of vessels of varying diameters(arteries, veins and capillaries).</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Symmetry</h4>
		<p>Animals can be categorised on the basis of their symmetry. Sponges are mostly <b>asymmetrical</b>, i.e., any plane that passes through the centre does not divide them into equal halves. When any plane passing through the central axis of the body divides the organism into two identical halves, it is called <b>radial symmetry</b>. Coelenterates, ctenophores and echinoderms have this kind of body plan. Animals like annelids, arthropods, etc., where the body can be divided into identical left and right halves in only one plane, exhibit <b>bilateral symmetry</b>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Diploblastic and Triploblastic Organisation</h4>
		<p>Animals in which the cells are arranged in two embryonic layers, an external <b>ectoderm</b> and an internal <b>endoderm</b>, are called <b>diploblastic</b> animals, e.g., coelenterates. An undifferentiated layer, mesoglea, is present in between the ectoderm and the endoderm Those animals in which the developing embryo has a third germinal layer, <b>mesoderm</b>, in between the ectoderm and endoderm, are called <b>triploblastic</b> animals</p>

		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Coelom</h4>
		<p>Presence or absence of a cavity between the body wall and the gut wall is very important in classification. The body cavity, which is lined by mesoderm is called <b>coelom</b>. Animals possessing coelom are called <b>coelomates</b>, e.g., annelids, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates. In some animals, the body cavity is not lined by mesoderm, instead, the mesoderm is present as scattered pouches in between the ectoderm and endoderm. Such a body cavity is called pseudocoelom and the animals possessing them are called <b>pseudocoelomates</b>, e.g., aschelminthes. The animals in which the body cavity is absent are called acoelomates, e.g., platyhelminthes</p>

		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Segmentation</h4>
		<p>In some animals, the body is externally and internally divided into segments with a serial repetition of at least some organs. For example, in earthworm, the body shows this pattern called metameric segmentation and the phenomenon is known as <b>metamerism</b>.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Notochord</h4>
		<p>Notochord is a mesodermally derived rod-like structure formed on the dorsal side during embryonic development in some animals. Animals with notochord are called chordates and those animals which do not form this structure are called non-chordates, e.g., porifera to echinoderms.</p>

	<p>The broad classification of Animalia based on common fundamental features as mentioned in the preceding sections is given</p>
	<div class="synopsis-image">
		<img src="image4.png" alt="image4" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"/>
	</div>
	<p>The important characteristic features of the different phyla are described.</p>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Phylum – Porifera</h4>
		<p>Members of this phylum are commonly known as sponges. They are generally marine and mostly asymmetrical animals. These are primitive multicellular animals and have cellular level of organisation. Sponges have a water transport or canal system. Water enters through minute pores (<b>ostia</b>) in the body wall into a central cavity, <b>spongocoel</b>, from where it goes out through the <b>osculum</b>. This pathway of water transport is helpful in food gathering, respiratory exchange and removal of waste. <b>Choanocytes</b> or collar cells line the spongocoel and the canals. Digestion is intracellular. The body is supported by a skeleton made up of <b>spicules</b> or <b>spongin fibres</b>. Sexes are not separate (<b>hermaphrodite</b>), i.e., eggs and sperms are produced by the same individual. Sponges reproduce asexually by fragmentation and sexually by formation of gametes. Fertilisation is internal and development is indirect having a larval stage which is morphologically distinct from the adult.<br/>
		Examples: Sycon (Scypha), Spongilla (Fresh water sponge) and Euspongia (Bath sponge).</p>

		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Phylum – Coelenterata (Cnidaria)</h4>
		<p>They are aquatic, mostly marine, sessile or free-swimming, radially symmetrical animals</p>
		<div class="synopsis-image">
			<img src="image6.png" alt="image6" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"/>
		</div>
		<p>The name cnidaria is derived from the cnidoblasts or cnidocytes (which contain the stinging capsules or nematocysts) present on the tentacles and the body. Cnidoblasts are used for anchorage, defense and for the capture of prey. Cnidarians exhibit tissue level of organisation and are diploblastic. They have a central gastro-vascular cavity with a single opening, mouth on <b>hypostome</b>. Digestion is extracellular and intracellular. Some of the cnidarians, e.g., <b>corals</b> have a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate. Cnidarians exhibit two basic body forms called <b>polyp</b> and <b>medusa</b>. The former is a sessile and cylindrical form like Hydra, Adamsia, etc. whereas, the latter is umbrella-shaped and free-swimming like Aurelia or jelly fish. Those cnidarians which exist in both forms exhibit alternation of generation (Metagenesis), i.e., polyps produce medusae asexually and medusae form the polyps sexually (e.g., Obelia).<br/>
	Examples: Physalia (Portuguese man-of-war), Adamsia (Sea anemone), Pennatula (Sea-pen), Gorgonia (Sea-fan) and Meandrina (Brain coral).</p>

	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Phylum – Ctenophora</h4>
		<p>Ctenophores, commonly known as <b>sea walnuts</b> or <b>comb jellies</b> are exclusively marine, radially symmetrical, diploblastic organisms with tissue level of organisation. The body bears eight external rows of ciliated <b>comb plates</b>, which help in locomotion. Digestion is both extracellular and intracellular. <b>Bioluminescence</b>(the property of a living organism to emit light) is well-marked in ctenophores. Sexes are not separate. Reproduction takes place only by sexual means. Fertilisation is external with indirect development.<br/>
		Examples: Pleurobrachia and Ctenoplana.</p>

	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Phylum – Platyhelminthes</h4>
		<p>They have dorso-ventrally flattened body, hence are called <b>flatworms</b>. These are mostly endoparasites found in animals including human beings. Flatworms are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and acoelomate animals with organ level of organisation. Hooks and suckers are present in the parasitic forms. Some of them absorb nutrients from the host directly through their body surface. Specialised cells called flame cells help in osmoregulation and excretion. Sexes are not separate. Fertilisation is internal and development is through many larval stages. Some members like Planaria possess high regeneration capacity.<br/>
		Examples: Taenia (Tapeworm), Fasciola (Liver fluke).</p>

	</section>
	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Phylum – Aschelminthes</h4>
		<p>The body of the aschelminthes is circular in cross-section, hence, the name <b>roundworms</b>. They may be freeliving, aquatic and terrestrial or parasitic in plants and animals. Roundworms have organ-system level of body organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and pseudocoelomate animals. Alimentary canal is complete with a well developed <b>muscular pharynx</b>. An excretory tube removes body wastes from the body cavity through the excretory pore. Sexes are separate(<b>dioecious</b>), i.e., males and females are distinct. Often females are longer than males. Fertilisation is internal and development may be direct (the young ones resemble the adult) or indirect.<br/>
		Examples : Ascaris (Roundworm), Wuchereria (Filaria worm), Ancylostoma (Hookworm).</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Phylum – Annelida</h4>
		<p>They may be aquatic (marine and fresh water) or terrestrial; free-living, and sometimes parasitic. They exhibit organ-system level of body organisation and bilateral symmetry. They are triploblastic, metamerically segmented and coelomate animals. Their body surface is distinctly marked out into <b>segments</b> or <b>metameres</b> and, hence, the phylum name Annelida (Latin, annulus : little ring). They possess longitudinal and circular muscles which help in locomotion. Aquatic annelids like Nereis possess lateral appendages, <b>parapodia</b>, which help in swimming. A closed circulatory system is present. <b>Nephridia</b>(sing. nephridium) help in osmoregulation and excretion. Neural system consists of paired ganglia (sing. ganglion) connected by lateral nerves to a double ventral nerve cord. Nereis, an aquatic form, is dioecious, but earthworms and leeches are monoecious. Reproduction is sexual.<br/>
		Examples : Nereis, Pheretima (Earthworm) and Hirudinaria (Blood sucking leech).</p>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Phylum – Arthropoda</h4>
		<p>This is the <b>largest phylum</b> of Animalia which includes insects. Over two-thirds of all named species on earth are arthropods. They have organ-system level of organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic, segmented and coelomate animals. The body of arthropods is covered by chitinous exoskeleton. The body consists of <b>head, thorax</b> and <b>abdomen</b>. They have <b>jointed appendages</b> (arthros-joint, poda-appendages). Respiratory organs are gills, book gills, book lungs or tracheal system. Circulatory system is of open type. Sensory organs like antennae, eyes (compound and simple), statocysts or balancing organs are present. Excretion takes place through <b>malpighian tubules</b>. They are mostly dioecious. Fertilisation is usually internal. They are mostly oviparous. Development may be direct or indirect.<br/>
		Examples: Economically important insects – Apis (Honey bee), Bombyx (Silkworm), Laccifer(Lac insect)<br/>
		Vectors – Anopheles, Culex and Aedes(Mosquitoes)<br/>

	<section class="subskill">
		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Phylum – Mollusca</h4>
		<p>This is the <b>second largest</b> animal phylum. Molluscs are terrestrial or aquatic (marine or fresh water) having an organ-system level of organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and coelomate animals. Body is covered by a calcareous shell and is unsegmented with a distinct <b>head, muscular foot</b> and <b>visceral hump</b>. A soft and spongy layer of skin forms a mantle over the visceral hump. The space between the hump and the mantle is called the mantle cavity in which feather like gills are present. They have respiratory and excretory functions. The anterior head region has sensory tentacles. The mouth contains a file-like rasping organ for feeding, called <b>radula</b>.<br/>
		They are usually dioecious and oviparous with indirect development.<br/>

		<h4 class="skill-subheading">Phylum – Echinodermata</h4>
		<p>These animals have an endoskeleton of calcareous ossicles and, hence, the name Echinodermata (Spiny bodied). All are marine with organ-system level of organisation. The adult echinoderms are radially symmetrical but larvae are bilaterally symmetrical. They are triploblastic and coelomate animals. Digestive system is complete with mouth on the lower (ventral) side and anus on the upper (dorsal) side. The most distinctive feature of echinoderms is the presence of <b>water vascular system</b> which helps in locomotion, capture and transport of food and respiration. An excretory system is absent. Sexes are separate. Reproduction is sexual. Fertilisation is usually external. Development is indirect with free-swimming larva.<br/>

		<p>Phylum Chordata is divided into three subphyla: <b>Urochordata</b> or <b>Tunicata, Cephalochordata</b> and <b>Vertebrata</b>.<br/>
		Subphyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are often referred to as <b>protochordates</b> and are exclusively marine. In Urochordata, notochord is present only in larval tail, while in Cephalochordata, it extends from head to tail region and is persistent throughout their life.<br/>
		Examples: Urochordata – Ascidia, Salpa, Doliolum; Cephalochordata – Branchiostoma(Amphioxus or Lancelet).<br/>
		The members of subphylum Vertebrata possess notochord during the embryonic period. The notochord is replaced by a cartilaginous or bony <b>vertebral column</b> in the adult. Thus all vertebrates are chordates but all chordates are not vertebrates. Besides the basic chordate characters, vertebrates have a ventral muscular heart with two, three or four chambers, kidneys for excretion and osmoregulation and paired appendages which may be fins or limbs.</p>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Class – Cyclostomata</h5>
		<p>All living members of the class Cyclostomata are ectoparasites on some fishes. They have an elongated body bearing 6-15 pairs of <b>gill slits</b> for respiration. Cyclostomes have a sucking and circular mouth without jaws. Their body is devoid of scales and paired fins. Cranium and vertebral column are cartilaginous. Circulation is of closed type. Cyclostomes are marine but migrate for spawning to fresh water. After spawning, within a few days, they die. Their larvae, after metamorphosis, return to the ocean.<br/>
	Examples: Petromyzon (Lamprey) and Myxine(Hagfish).</p>

			<img src="image19.png" alt="image19" class="default-synopsis-medium-image"/>
		</div>
		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Class – Chondrichthyes</h5>
		<p>They are marine animals with streamlined body and have cartilaginous endoskeleton. Mouth is located ventrally. <b>Notochord</b> is <b>persistent</b> throughout life. Gill slits are separate and without <b>operculum</b>(gill cover). The skin is tough, containing minute <b>placoid scales</b>. Teeth are modified placoid scales which are backwardly directed. Their jaws are very powerful. These animals are predaceous. Due to the absence of air bladder, they have to swim constantly to avoid sinking. Heart is two-chambered (one auricle and one ventricle). Some of them have <b>electric organs</b>(e.g., Torpedo) and some possess <b>poison sting</b>(e.g., Trygon). They are cold-blooded(<b>poikilothermous</b>) animals, i.e., they lack the capacity to regulate their body temperature. Sexes are separate. In males pelvic fins bear claspers. They have internal fertilisation and many of them are viviparous.<br/>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Class – Aves</h5>
		<p>The characteristic features of Aves (birds) are the presence of <b>feathers</b> and most of them can fly except flightless birds (e.g., Ostrich). They possess <b>beak</b>. The forelimbs are modified into <b>wings</b>. The hind limbs generally have scales and are modified for walking, swimming or clasping the tree branches. Skin is dry without glands except the oil gland at the base of the tail. Endoskeleton is fully ossified (bony) and the long bones are hollow with <b>air cavities</b>(pneumatic). The digestive tract of birds has additional chambers, the crop and gizzard. Heart is completely four chambered. They are warm-blooded(<b>homoiothermous</b>) animals, i.e., they are able to maintain a constant body temperature. Respiration is by lungs. Air sacs connected to lungs supplement respiration. Sexes are separate. Fertilisation is internal. They are oviparous and development is direct.<br/>

		<h5 class="skill-smallheading">Class – Mammalia</h5>
		<p>They are found in a variety of habitats – polar ice caps, deserts, mountains, forests, grasslands and dark caves. Some of them have adapted to fly or live in water. The most unique mammalian characteristic is the presence of milk producing glands (<b>mammary glands</b>) by which the young ones are nourished. They have two pairs of limbs, adapted for walking, running, climbing, burrowing, swimming or flying. The skin of mammals is unique in possessing <b>hair</b>. External ears or <b>pinnae</b> are present. Different types of teeth are present in the jaw. Heart is four chambered. They are homoiothermous. Respiration is by lungs. Sexes are separate and fertilisation is internal. They are viviparous with few exceptions and development is direct.<br/>
